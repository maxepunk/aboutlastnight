            <h2 class="section-header">What exactly is 'About Last Night...'?</h2>

            <p>Think escape room meets murder mystery — but you're not solving for the "right" answer.</p>

            <p>Every puzzle unlocks a piece of the past. Backstory. Relationships. What actually happened at that party. Call it narrative archeology. You're digging up secrets that belong to everyone in the room.</p>

            <p>But here's the thing: you get to <span class="corrupt">CHOOSE</span> whether or not you share what you've found.</p>

            <p>Bury a memory for profit. Expose it as evidence. Trade it for leverage. The "truth" that emerges isn't always the objective truth. </p>	


			<p> Instead, as you discover more about yourself and others, you are piecing together a 'truth' convincing enough to the authorities to clear <span class="corrupt">YOUR </span> name. </p>

            <p>You don't need to be an actor — there's no audience watching. You don't need to be a puzzle expert — you could never touch a lock and still play a crucial role in shaping the story.</p>

            <p>You just need to decide: what kind of story do you want to tell tonight?</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Our Philosophy</h2>

            <p>About Last Night... is a collage of game elements 'aren't supposed to go together'</p>
			
			<p>We wanted to combine our favorite aspects of escape rooms, immersive experiences, and tabletop gaming. </p>
			
			<p>We wanted to explore the boundaries of what is possible in experience design.</p> 
       
			<p> We wanted it to be a game that is still accessible to all of our friends, without asking them to be actors, puzzle savants, or social butterflies.</p>
			
			<p> Most of all, in an age when our personal information and ability to connect are getting increasingly commoditized, we wanted to create a social experience where we could collectively explore some very-real-sh*t™ through the lens of fiction. </p>

            <p>This project is made by a small team of independent artists who've spent years in escape rooms, immersive theater, and game design, using our personal resources to  to create something weird and interesting while equitably paying our performers and facilitators who make running our game possible.</p>

            <p>It's ambitious. It's DIY. And it is constantly evolving.</p>

            <p>Every run we learn something to make it better.</p>

            <p>If that sounds like your kind of weird, <a href="submit-evidence" class="corrupt">Join the party!</a> Let's tell a story  <span class="corrupt">about last night</span> together.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">No, the entrance will always be unlocked the whole time. You are free to leave  at any point if needed. This is a playable, interactive puzzle mystery experience, but safety is always our main concern and no participants will be locked or bound in any way.</p>

                    <strong>What's the sweet spot?</strong> The game scales well across the range, but 10-16 players tends to hit the best balance of social complexity and puzzle coverage. Smaller groups (5-8) feel more intimate and collaborative. Larger groups (16-20) beget more chaotic negotiation and competing agendas.<br><br>
                    Don't have a full group? You'll be paired with others. Trust us, playing with strangers adds to the tension and strategy.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">Possibly. This game thrives on unexpected alliances and rivalries. This game is designed to mitigate the awkwardness of talking to strangers, and in our earlier runs, we've even seen new friendships form. If you prefer a private session, book any empty time slot. There's an option to block out the rest of the player slots for a small fee.</p>

                        We set the ticket price for About Last Night... to reflect the costs of running an experience with actors in the SF Bay Area. However, we hate that puzzle games and immersive experiences are typically only accessible to the privileged. If you're interested in experiencing About Last Night... but the price is prohibitive for you, please feel free to use one of these promo codes to make the experience accessible.  We make all of these discount levels available and trust our players to choose based on their level of need:<br><br>
