# About Last Night - Game Overview

## The Experience

"About Last Night" is a 2-hour immersive crime thriller where players wake up with amnesia after a party where their friend Marcus was murdered and four of their friends were kidnapped. Players must piece together what happened using memory tokens, physical evidence, and relationships while navigating moral choices about what to reveal.

### Time Structure

**PAST (2010-2025):** Timeline Events database
- All events before party night
- Character backstory and relationships
- Grounded by physical Elements (evidence)

**CLIMAX:** Party night itself
- Marcus dies at the party
- Four friends kidnapped by Blake
- Memories extracted from all attendees
- Still considered PAST (happened before game starts)

**PRESENT:** 2-hour gameplay
- Players solve puzzles with amnesia
- Scan memory tokens using RFID technology
- Make choices: Hold / Sell to Blake / Turn In to Detective
- Navigate moral tension between freeing hostages vs building case

### Win Conditions

**Free Hostages:** Sell Blake 4 specific ransom tokens
- Oliver Sterling's medical formulations (Tertiary, COVERUP)
- James Whitman's memory of Marcus's secret laboratory (Core, JUSTICE)
- Howie Sullivan's lecture notes on adaptive collaboration (Tertiary, RECOVERY)
- Leila Bishara's private collection of algorithms (Tertiary, PRAGMATIC)

**Build Case Against Marcus:** Turn In evidence to Detective
- Expose corruption, wrongdoing, betrayals
- Create public record on detective's shared screen
- Accountability over profit

**Moral Tension:** Players navigate between these competing goals based on their goal cluster motivations.

## Four Goal Clusters (Character Motivations)

Goal clusters represent character motivations that drive gameplay decisions. Each character belongs to ONE cluster.

### JUSTICE (Prefix: E-)

**Mantra:** "Someone needs to answer for what happened, and you're going to make sure they do."

**Characters (5):**
- E - Ashe Motoko (Justice-Seeking Journalist)
- E - Alex Reeves (Wronged Partner)
- E - James Whitman (Funding Rival)  
- E - Jessicah Kane (Heartbroken Actor)
- E - Diana Nilsson (The Party Lawyer)

**Gameplay Tendency:** Detective-aligned (Turn In evidence)

**Token Themes:**
- Accountability and exposure
- Professional betrayals and corruption
- Evidence that builds a case
- Documentation of wrongdoing

**Design Rule:** Owner's cluster determines token framing even when multiple characters involved. JUSTICE tokens reveal corruption and seek accountability.

### RECOVERY (Prefix: R-)

**Mantra:** "They took something from you all without asking, and you're going to get it back."

**Characters (5):**
- R - Derek Thorne (Marcus' Plug)
- R - Howie Sullivan (Tech Sage of Connection)
- R - Kai Andersen (Ambitious Dreamer)
- R - Jamie Volt (Invisible Witness)
- R - Rachel Torres (Loyal Advocate)

**Gameplay Tendency:** Hold-oriented (value tokens as memories)

**Token Themes:**
- Reclamation and restoration
- Personal stakes and loss
- Community and connection
- What was taken without permission

**Design Rule:** RECOVERY tokens focus on what needs to be reclaimed, not punitive justice.

### COVERUP (Prefix: P-)

**Mantra:** "There's something that must stay hidden, no matter what you have to do."

**Characters (6):**
- P - Victoria Kingsley (Irritated Investor)
- P - Oliver Sterling (Trapped Scientist)
- P - Skyler Iyer (Cutthroat Strategist)
- P - Tori Zhang (Frustrated Dreamweaver)
- P - Flip (Party Architect)
- P - Morgan Reed (Crisis Manager)

**Gameplay Tendency:** Blake-aligned (bury evidence)

**Token Themes:**
- Secrets and protection
- Dangerous truths that must stay hidden
- Complex moral choices
- Information that could harm if revealed

**Design Rule:** COVERUP tokens contain dangerous truths. High SF_ValueRating justified by what Blake will pay to bury them.

### PRAGMATIC (Prefix: S-)

**Mantra:** "The past is only worth what you make of it, and you're not walking away empty-handed."

**Characters (4):**
- S - Sarah Blackwood (Resentful Spouse)
- S - Sofia Francisco (Disillusioned Filmmaker)
- S - Leila Bishara (Blockchain Maverick)
- S - Taylor Chase (Hype Architect)

**Gameplay Tendency:** Sell-oriented (maximize value)

**Token Themes:**
- Transactional relationships
- Opportunistic leverage
- Deals and negotiations
- Commodification of memories

**Design Rule:** PRAGMATIC tokens treat memories as commodities. Voice should be calculated, not sentimental.

## Three Tier System

### Core Tier (Always Active)
**Activation:** Required for minimum viable game
**Density:** High narrative presence
- More owned elements (6-10)
- Central to main narrative threads
- Complex puzzle touchpoints

**Examples:** Ashe, Alex, James, Sarah

### Secondary Tier (≥15 Players)
**Activation:** Active when 15 or more players
**Density:** Medium narrative presence
- Moderate owned elements (4-7)
- Supporting narrative roles
- Standard puzzle integration

**Examples:** Diana, Jessicah

### Tertiary Tier (≥20 Players)
**Activation:** Active when 20 or more players
**Density:** Lower narrative presence BUT can own critical mechanics
- Fewer owned elements acceptable (2-5)
- Can own critical ransom tokens

**Examples:** Oliver, Howie, Leila (all own ransom tokens)

**Critical Insight:** Tier ≠ importance. Mechanical significance independent of narrative density. 3 of 4 ransom tokens owned by Tertiary characters.

## Five Narrative Threads

Thematic arcs that organize story content. Elements assign to ONE thread.

### 1. Funding & Espionage
**Current Coverage:** 7 elements, 1 token
**Themes:**
- Corporate intrigue and competition
- VC relationships and betrayals
- BizAI vs NeurAI rivalry
- Financial machinations

**Thread Question:** "How did business conflicts escalate to murder?"

### 2. Marriage Troubles
**Current Coverage:** 4 elements, 0 tokens
**Themes:**
- Sarah/Marcus relationship dissolution
- Partnership breakdown
- Personal betrayals in professional context
- Resentment and disillusionment

**Thread Question:** "How did personal relationships fracture?"

### 3. Memory Drug
**Current Coverage:** 2 elements, 0 tokens
**Themes:**
- Underground parties and Derek's dealing
- Memory extraction technology
- Ethical boundaries crossed
- Chemical and technical innovation

**Thread Question:** "What was the memory drug and how was it used?"

### 4. Underground Parties
**Current Coverage:** 2 elements, 0 tokens
**Themes:**
- Derek/Marcus party history
- Community and social network
- Venues and gatherings
- Party culture and rituals

**Thread Question:** "What was the underground party scene?"

### 5. Advanced Technology
**Current Coverage:** 1 element, 0 tokens
**Themes:**
- NeurAI development and innovation
- AI ethics and implications
- Technical breakthroughs
- Research and development

**Thread Question:** "What technical innovations drove the story?"

**Critical Gap:** 4 of 5 threads have ZERO tokens. Threads organize narrative; tokens enable player choice moments within themes.

## Scanner Display Contexts (CRITICAL)

Memory tokens have THREE display contexts with different audiences and purposes.

### Context 1: Description/Text Field (Private Scanner)
**Audience:** Only the team HOLDING the token
**Purpose:** Decision support for Hold / Sell / Turn In choice
**Content:** Full narrative text + SF_ fields (separated by line breaks)
**Design Implication:** Players use this private view to decide what to do with token

### Context 2: SF_Summary Field (Public Detective Log)
**Audience:** ALL players (when token turned in to Detective)
**Display:** Appears on shared "detective log" screen visible to entire room
**Purpose:** Public case evidence statement
**Design Implication:** Must work as evidence that builds case, not spoil full content

### Context 3: Blake's Auction
**Audience:** Team selling to Blake
**Display:** Shows SF_ValueRating to determine payment
**Purpose:** Communicate token's market value
**Design Implication:** ValueRating must be justified by narrative stakes

**CRITICAL RULE:** SF_Summary must work in BOTH Context 1 (private decision support) AND Context 2 (public evidence). See sf-mechanics.md for dual-context writing patterns.

## Blake's Black Market Ransom

Blake holds four hostages (Marcus's friends) and demands four specific tokens in exchange for their freedom.

### The Four Ransom Tokens
All have `SF_Group = "Black Market Ransom"`:

1. **Oliver Sterling's medical formulations** (Tertiary, COVERUP)
   - Dangerous research Blake needs
   - Technical MemoryType

2. **James Whitman's memory of Marcus's secret laboratory** (Core, JUSTICE)
   - Evidence of hidden research facility
   - Business/Technical MemoryType

3. **Howie Sullivan's lecture notes on adaptive collaboration** (Tertiary, RECOVERY)
   - Methodology for building connections
   - Business/Personal MemoryType

4. **Leila Bishara's private collection of algorithms** (Tertiary, PRAGMATIC)
   - Proprietary technical knowledge
   - Technical MemoryType

### Design Constraints
- ONLY these 4 tokens should have SF_Group value
- All must have SF_ValueRating = 5 (mechanically necessary)
- Most tokens have empty SF_Group field
- 3 of 4 owned by Tertiary tier (proves Tier ≠ importance)

---

## Database Relationships

### Four Databases

**Characters:** 20 playable characters
- Fields: Tier, Goal Cluster, Logline, Overview & Key Relationships, Emotion towards CEO, Primary Action
- These narrative context fields are "given circumstances" for token design

**Elements:** Tokens, props, documents, set dressing
- ALL types deliver narrative through Description/Text field
- For tokens: Description/Text contains narrative content + SF_ fields
- Central database - only one with Narrative Threads field

**Timeline:** PAST backstory events (2010-2025)
- Grounds elements in history
- Creates Associated Characters rollup
- No direct thread assignment (inherits via elements)

**Puzzles:** Game mechanics, containers, reward chains
- PRESENT tense mechanics
- Elements as inputs/outputs
- Inherit threads via Rewards rollup

### Owner vs Associated (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

**Owner (Element → Character relation):**
- Whose POV/possession is this element?
- Belongs to this character
- Their personal perspective
- ONE owner per element

**Associated Characters (Element rollup via Timeline):**
- Who's involved in the backstory event this evidences?
- DIFFERENT from Owner
- Shared timeline events create Associated Characters rollup
- Multiple associated characters possible

**Example:** Derek owns Stanford graduation photo (Owner = Derek). Photo evidences 2015 Stanford event with attendees Derek, Marcus, Diana, Sofia (Associated = all four).

**Why This Matters:** Complete coverage analysis requires checking BOTH owned elements (character's POV) AND associated elements (appearances in others' stories).

## Trust Pairs

From character sheets: "You know you can trust [name]"

### Complete Trust Network
- Sarah ↔ Rachel
- Sarah ↔ Alex
- James ↔ Tori
- Derek ↔ Diana
- Derek ↔ Jessicah
- Diana ↔ Sofia
- Diana ↔ Jamie
- Victoria ↔ Skyler
- Ashe ↔ Leila
- Ashe ↔ Kai
- Jessicah ↔ Derek
- Howie ↔ Oliver
- Oliver ↔ Leila
- Oliver ↔ Skyler
- Oliver ↔ James
- Kai ↔ Flip
- Morgan ↔ Taylor

### Cross-Cluster Pairs (Notable)
These create interesting gameplay dynamics:
- JUSTICE ↔ RECOVERY: Derek ↔ Jessicah, Derek ↔ Diana, Diana ↔ Jamie
- JUSTICE ↔ PRAGMATIC: Sarah ↔ Alex, Sarah ↔ Rachel
- JUSTICE ↔ COVERUP: James ↔ Tori
- RECOVERY ↔ COVERUP: Howie ↔ Oliver
- RECOVERY ↔ PRAGMATIC: Ashe ↔ Leila
- COVERUP ↔ PRAGMATIC: Oliver ↔ Leila, Victoria ↔ Skyler

Trust pairs should have shared timeline events grounding their relationship. Use trust_pair_verification.py to check.

## Current Data Quality State

From tool outputs (as of skill creation):
- 37 memory tokens exist
- 94.6% lack thread assignments
- Thread coverage uneven (4 of 5 threads have 0 tokens)
- Content exists - needs proper wiring and organization

**Skill Strategy:** Wire existing content BEFORE creating new content. Systematic workflows handle messy state.
