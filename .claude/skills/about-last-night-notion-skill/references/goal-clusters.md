# Goal Clusters - Token Design Patterns

## Quick Reference

The four goal clusters represent character motivations that drive gameplay decisions. Each cluster has distinct content patterns, emotional tones, and SF_ field implications for token design.

**JUSTICE (E-):** Accountability, exposure, evidence-gathering. Detective-aligned. Tokens reveal corruption/wrongdoing. High ValueRating for evidence, Business/Technical MemoryType common.

**RECOVERY (R-):** Reclamation, restoration, personal stakes. Hold-oriented. Tokens about loss and what was taken. Variable ValueRating, Personal MemoryType dominant.

**COVERUP (P-):** Secrets, protection, hiding. Blake-aligned. Tokens contain dangerous truths. High ValueRating (valuable to bury), mix of all MemoryTypes.

**PRAGMATIC (S-):** Transactional, opportunistic, leverage-seeking. Sell-oriented. Tokens as commodities. ValueRating reflects market value, Business MemoryType common.

## JUSTICE Cluster (Prefix: E-)

### Overview & Mantra

**From COMPREHENSIVE_KNOWLEDGE.md:**

**Mantra**: "Someone needs to answer for what happened, and you're going to make sure they do."

**Characters**: 
- Ashe Motoko (Justice-Seeking Journalist)
- Alex Reeves (Wronged Partner)
- James Whitman (Funding Rival)
- Jessicah Kane (Heartbroken Actor)
- Diana Nilsson (The Party Lawyer)

**Core Motivation:**
- Seek accountability and exposure
- Strong moral compass
- Likely to support Detective over Blake
- Elements should reveal corruption/wrongdoing

### Content Themes for Token Design

**What JUSTICE tokens should contain:**

**Professional Betrayals & Corruption:**
- Evidence of wrongdoing in business contexts
- Documentation of ethical violations
- Proof of deception or manipulation
- Records showing harm caused by others' actions

**Investigative Evidence:**
- Information that builds a case
- Corroborating evidence for larger patterns
- Documentation that exposes hidden truth
- Data that reveals systemic problems

**Accountability Documentation:**
- Communications showing intent to harm
- Evidence of broken promises or agreements
- Proof contradicting public narratives
- Records of who knew what when

**Personal Impact of Injustice:**
- How professional wrongdoing affected relationships
- Emotional cost of being wronged
- Moments realizing the scope of betrayal
- Decisions to act despite consequences

**Content Patterns:**
- JUSTICE tokens often contain both professional evidence AND emotional reaction
- Technical/Business information that PROVES wrongdoing
- Personal moments that show WHY the character cares
- Forward momentum: discovery → decision to act → gathering evidence

### SF_ Field Patterns for JUSTICE

**SF_MemoryType Distribution:**

**Business (Most Common):**
- Professional communications about wrongdoing
- Corporate evidence of ethical violations
- Partnership betrayals, funding deception
- Example: Alex's evidence of Marcus's business practices

**Technical (Common for Evidence):**
- Technical data proving malfeasance
- System logs, formulations, specifications that expose problems
- Example: Technical specifications showing product doesn't work as claimed

**Personal (Less Common but Powerful):**
- Emotional moments of realization
- Personal impact of professional wrongdoing
- Confrontation about betrayal
- Example: Personal message realizing extent of deception

**Pattern:** JUSTICE tokens typically start Business/Technical (evidence) but most impactful ones include Personal dimension (why it matters).

**SF_ValueRating Patterns:**

**High Value (4-5) JUSTICE Tokens:**
- Evidence critical to building case against Marcus
- Proof of major wrongdoing with serious consequences
- Information that changes moral calculus for other players
- Documentation that exposes systemic corruption

**Medium Value (3) JUSTICE Tokens:**
- Supporting evidence for larger patterns
- Personal betrayals with broader implications
- Proof of problems but not game-changing

**Lower Value (1-2) JUSTICE Tokens:**
- Personal grievances without broader significance
- Minor evidence that doesn't shift narratives
- Emotional reactions without actionable information

**Pattern:** JUSTICE characters value evidence proportionally to how much it exposes. Detective wants tokens that build comprehensive case.

**SF_Summary Writing for JUSTICE:**

**Detective Scanner Context:**
JUSTICE tokens should present as case-building evidence. Detective displays them publicly as proof of wrongdoing. Summary should work in scoreboard context.

**Good Pattern:**
- "Evidence of [specific wrongdoing] by [person]"
- "Proof that [claim] contradicts [reality]"
- "Documentation showing [person] knew about [problem]"

**Avoid:**
- Vague emotional descriptions without specifics
- "Smoking gun" language (let evidence speak)
- Pure personal grievance without actionable content

**NeurAI Scanner Context (Player View):**
Players deciding whether to expose need to understand what evidence PROVES. Summary should clarify significance without editorializing.

### Character Database Field Interpretation for JUSTICE

**Overview & Key Relationships:**
Look for:
- Mentions of being wronged or betrayed
- Professional relationships gone sour
- History of advocacy or seeking truth
- Trust pairs often with other justice-seekers or those harmed

**Token Design Implication:** JUSTICE tokens should ground claims made in Overview. If character says "Marcus betrayed our partnership," token should evidence this.

**Emotion towards CEO & others:**
Common patterns:
- Anger (righteous, not petty)
- Betrayal and disappointment
- Determination to expose
- Moral conviction despite personal cost

**Token Design Implication:** Voice should reflect this emotional register. JUSTICE tokens are serious, evidence-focused, driven by conviction.

**Primary Action (PRESENT tense gameplay):**
Common patterns:
- "Build case against Marcus"
- "Expose the truth about..."
- "Ensure accountability for..."
- "Support Detective's investigation"

**Token Design Implication:** Tokens should support this PRESENT action. Past evidence enables present investigation.

**Character Logline:**
Often includes:
- "Justice-seeking," "Wronged," "Betrayed"
- Professional identity (journalist, partner, rival)
- Sense of moral purpose

**Token Design Implication:** Token content should exemplify this essence.

### Token Design Workflow for JUSTICE Characters

**1. Review Character Context:**
- Read Overview: What specific wrongdoing matters to them?
- Read Emotion: What's the emotional register? (Anger vs. disappointment vs. determination)
- Read Primary Action: What are they trying to accomplish in PRESENT?
- Read Logline: What's their essence?

**2. Identify Token Purpose:**
- What evidence do they need to support their case?
- What past moment grounds their present motivation?
- What information would Detective find valuable?

**3. Design Content:**
- Content should be specific evidence, not vague grievance
- Include both facts (Business/Technical) and impact (Personal dimension)
- Show why this matters beyond personal vendetta
- Forward momentum: this evidence enables action

**4. Set SF_ Fields:**
- MemoryType: Start with what evidence IS (Business/Technical), add Personal if emotional dimension matters
- ValueRating: How significant is this evidence? Does it change the game or just support existing narrative?
- Summary: Write for Detective scoreboard context - clear statement of what this proves

**5. Ground in Timeline:**
- Ensure event exists showing when/how this evidence was created or discovered
- Verify other characters involved are in timeline event
- Check if trust pairs are supported by this evidence

### SF_ Field Patterns for RECOVERY

**SF_MemoryType Distribution:**

**Personal (Most Common):**
- Memories of relationships and community
- Personal experiences worth preserving
- Emotional moments showing what matters
- Example: Derek's memories of parties and friends

**Business (Less Common):**
- Professional relationships as personal connections

- Example: Kai's lost opportunities

**Technical (Rare):**
- Technical knowledge as personal investment
- Systems built that were destroyed
- Collaborative work products
- Example: Howie's technical contributions to community

**Pattern:** RECOVERY tokens are predominantly Personal because stakes are interpersonal, not professional. Even business context is about personal relationships.

**SF_ValueRating Patterns:**

**High Value (4-5) RECOVERY Tokens:**
- Core memories of identity or community
- Evidence of major losses (relationships, opportunities)
- Information critical to understanding what Blake took
- Memories that restoration depends on holding

**Medium Value (3) RECOVERY Tokens:**

**Lower Value (1-2) RECOVERY Tokens:**
- Pleasant but not critical memories
- Personal moments without broader stakes
- Nice-to-have rather than need-to-have

**Pattern:** Value correlates with how central the memory is to character's sense of self and community. Hold to restore identity.

**SF_Summary Writing for RECOVERY:**

**Detective Scanner Context:**
RECOVERY tokens may not advance Detective's case directly. Summary should clarify personal significance without being dismissive.

**Pattern:**
- "Memory of [relationship/experience] before [loss]"
- "[Character]'s recollection of [community/connection]"
- "Personal experience of [what matters to them]"

**NeurAI Scanner Context (Player View):**
Players deciding whether to hold need to understand what restoration means. Summary should convey emotional/personal significance.

**Pattern:**
- Show what's at stake personally
- Clarify why this memory matters to character
- Help player understand recovery motivation

### Character Database Field Interpretation for RECOVERY

**Overview & Key Relationships:**
Look for:
- Emphasis on community and connection
- Descriptions of what was lost or disrupted

**SF_Summary Writing for COVERUP:**

**Detective Scanner Context:**
COVERUP tokens as evidence of what people want hidden. Summary should hint at significance without full reveal (players scan before deciding).

**Pattern:**
- "[Character]'s evidence of [compromising situation]"
- "Documentation showing [problem/secret] was known"
- "Record of [action] that [consequence if revealed]"

**NeurAI Scanner Context (Player View):**
Players deciding Blake vs. Detective need to understand:
1. What the secret IS
2. Why it matters
3. Who gets hurt by exposure

**Blake wants these buried. Detective wants exposure. Hold means... what? Player decides.**

### Character Database Field Interpretation for COVERUP

**Overview & Key Relationships:**
Look for:
- Mentions of pressure, compromise, difficult positions
- Professional success with complications
- Relationships complicated by secrets or stakes

- Leila Bishara (Blockchain Maverick)
- Taylor Chase (Hype Architect)

**Core Motivation:**
- Transactional mindset
- Opportunity seekers
- May sell to Blake for profit
- Elements about leverage/deals

### Content Themes for Token Design

**What PRAGMATIC tokens should contain:**

**Leverage & Advantage:**
- Information valuable in negotiations
- Evidence of leverage over others
- Documentation of value (financial, social, reputational)
- Proof of ownership or claims

**Transactional Relationships:**
- Business dealings and partnerships

- Voice is matter-of-fact, not angry or sentimental

### SF_ Field Patterns for PRAGMATIC

**SF_MemoryType Distribution:**

**Business (Most Common):**
- Professional relationships as transactions
- Partnership arrangements and deals
- Evidence of value exchange
- Example: Sarah's marriage as business arrangement gone wrong

**Technical (Less Common):**
- Technical assets with commercial value
- Intellectual property and innovations
- System knowledge with market applications
- Example: Technical expertise that could be sold

**Personal (Least Common but Strategic):**
- Personal information with transactional value
- Relationship evidence that provides leverage
- Private moments that have market significance
- Example: Personal knowledge that others would pay to hide

**Pattern:** PRAGMATIC tokens frame even Personal content transactionally. Relationships are evaluated for leverage, not emotional significance.

**SF_ValueRating Patterns:**

**High Value (4-5) PRAGMATIC Tokens:**
- Information with clear market value to Blake
- Evidence providing significant leverage
- Documentation of major opportunities or assets
- Tokens Blake would pay premium for

**Medium Value (3) PRAGMATIC Tokens:**
- Useful information with moderate commercial value
- Evidence providing some leverage
- Documentation of minor opportunities

**Lower Value (1-2) PRAGMATIC Tokens:**
- Information with minimal market value
- Evidence without clear leverage applications
- Personal content without transactional utility

**Pattern:** Value is LITERAL market value. PRAGMATIC characters assess: "What would Blake pay for this?"

**SF_Summary Writing for PRAGMATIC:**

**Detective Scanner Context:**
PRAGMATIC tokens may not support case building directly. Summary should clarify what information contains without editorial about motives.

**Pattern:**
- "[Character]'s documentation of [deal/relationship/asset]"
- "Evidence showing [value/leverage/opportunity]"
- "Record of [transaction/arrangement]"

**NeurAI Scanner Context (Player View):**
Players deciding whether to sell need to understand token's market value. Summary should clarify what Blake might pay for.

**Pattern:**
- Clear statement of what information contains
- Hint at transactional value
- Let player calculate leverage potential

### Character Database Field Interpretation for PRAGMATIC

**Overview & Key Relationships:**
Look for:
- Disappointment with idealism or others
- Transactional language about relationships
- Evidence of being used or undervalued
- Trust pairs often strategic, not purely personal

**Token Design Implication:** PRAGMATIC tokens should ground transactional thinking. Show the disillusionment documented in Overview.

**Emotion towards CEO & others:**
Common patterns:
- Resentment (not moral outrage)
- Disappointment and disillusionment
- Calculation about cost-benefit
- Focus on self-interest and exit strategy

**Token Design Implication:** Voice is pragmatic, not emotional. PRAGMATIC tokens are matter-of-fact, even about painful topics.

**Primary Action (PRESENT tense gameplay):**
Common patterns:
- "Get what I'm owed"
- "Maximize value from this situation"
- "Don't walk away empty-handed"
- "Sell to Blake for profit"

**Token Design Implication:** Tokens should have clear market value. Content shows assets or leverage worth monetizing.

**Character Logline:**
Often includes:
- Disappointment or disillusionment
- Pragmatic or transactional language
- Focus on value or opportunity

**Token Design Implication:** Token content should exemplify this pragmatic worldview.

### Token Design Workflow for PRAGMATIC Characters

**1. Review Character Context:**
- Read Overview: What disappointed them? What do they value?
- Read Emotion: What's the tone? (Resentment vs. calculation)
- Read Primary Action: What are they trying to extract from this situation?
- Read Logline: What defines their pragmatic approach?

**2. Identify Token Purpose:**
- What information has market value to Blake?
- What evidence provides leverage?
- What documentation shows assets or opportunities?

**3. Design Content:**

## Cross-Cluster Token Design Considerations

### When Content Could Fit Multiple Clusters

Some narrative content could plausibly belong to multiple clusters. The character's goal cluster determines framing and voice.

**Example Scenario: Marcus's betrayal of a business partner**

**JUSTICE framing (E- character):**
- Focus: Evidence of wrongdoing, building case
- Voice: Moral conviction, exposure motivation
- SF_MemoryType: Business (evidence)
- SF_ValueRating: High (critical evidence)
- Summary: "Evidence of Marcus's fraud against [partner]"

**RECOVERY framing (R- character):**
- Focus: Loss of relationship, community disrupted
- Voice: Personal grief, restoration motivation
- SF_MemoryType: Personal (relationship loss)
- SF_ValueRating: Medium-High (identity-defining relationship)
- Summary: "Memory of partnership before Marcus's betrayal"

**COVERUP framing (P- character):**
- Focus: Complicity, knowing about problem but not acting
- Voice: Pressure, impossible position
- SF_MemoryType: Business (professional compromise)
- SF_ValueRating: High (secret to bury)
- Summary: "Evidence of knowing about Marcus's fraud"

**PRAGMATIC framing (S- character):**
- Focus: Lost opportunity, leverage potential
- Voice: Calculation, exit strategy
- SF_MemoryType: Business (value assessment)
- SF_ValueRating: Variable (depends on market value)
- Summary: "Documentation of partnership dissolution and assets"

**Design Rule:** Same event, four different tokens depending on character. Goal cluster determines focus, voice, and SF_ field framing.

### Multi-Character Tokens

Some events involve characters from multiple clusters. Who OWNS the token determines framing.

**Example: Trust pair with cross-cluster relationship**
- Sarah (PRAGMATIC) trusts Rachel (RECOVERY)
- Sarah owns token about their friendship
- Token is framed PRAGMATICALLY (transactional support)
- If Rachel owned token about same friendship
- Token would be framed as RECOVERY (emotional support, community)

**Design Rule:** Owner's cluster determines token framing, even when multiple characters involved.

### Cluster-Neutral Content

Some token content is relatively cluster-neutral (facts, documentation, technical information without strong emotional framing).

**Examples:**
- Technical specifications
- Timeline documentation
- Factual records

**Design Approach:**
Even cluster-neutral content should have voice aligned with owner's cluster:
- JUSTICE: Presented as evidence
- RECOVERY: Presented as preservation
- COVERUP: Presented as protected information
- PRAGMATIC: Presented as asset or leverage

**SF_Summary should reflect cluster framing even when content is factual.**

---

## Anti-Patterns: Common Token Design Mistakes

### Anti-Pattern 1: Cluster Confusion

**Mistake:** Token content and SF_ fields don't align with owner's goal cluster.

**Example:**
- Owner: Sarah (PRAGMATIC)
- Content: Emotional, sentimental memory about friendship
- Voice: "I'll always treasure this moment..."
- SF_Summary: "Cherished memory of friendship"

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- PRAGMATIC characters aren't sentimental
- Content doesn't support cluster mantra
- SF_ fields should reflect transactional framing

**Fix:**
- Same friendship, PRAGMATIC framing
- Voice: "Rachel was one of few people who got it"
- SF_Summary: "Evidence of strategic alliance with Rachel"

### Anti-Pattern 2: Cluster Stereotype

**Mistake:** Reducing characters to cartoon versions of their cluster.

**Example:**
- JUSTICE character as righteous scold
- RECOVERY character as purely sentimental
- COVERUP character as evil villain
- PRAGMATIC character as sociopathic sellout

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Characters are complex humans, not archetypes
- Clusters are motivations, not personality types
- Stereotypes make characters unplayable

**Fix:**
- Show complexity within cluster framing
- JUSTICE can be weary, not just angry
- RECOVERY can be strategic about preservation
- COVERUP can be sympathetic in impossible position
- PRAGMATIC can care while being transactional

### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring Character Database Fields

**Mistake:** Designing tokens without reading character's database fields.

**Example:**
- Owner: Oliver (COVERUP)
- Character Emotion field: "Trapped, desperate to protect research"
- Token voice: Confident, aggressive coverup
- Doesn't match character's actual emotional state

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Character database fields are "given circumstances"
- They provide voice, tone, emotional register
- Ignoring them creates inconsistency

**Fix:**
- Always read all four character database fields before designing tokens
- Match voice to Emotion field
- Ground content in Overview field
- Support Primary Action with token content
- Exemplify Logline in token essence

### Anti-Pattern 4: ValueRating Without Justification

**Mistake:** Assigning ValueRating without narrative justification.

**Example:**
- Token: Minor personal moment
- SF_ValueRating: 5 (maximum value)
- No explanation for why Blake would pay premium

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- ValueRating should match narrative stakes
- High value requires high stakes/significance
- Arbitrary ratings break game economy

**Fix:**
- ValueRating 4-5: Game-changing information, critical secrets, identity-defining memories
- ValueRating 3: Meaningful but not critical
- ValueRating 1-2: Minor information, low stakes

### Anti-Pattern 5: Wrong MemoryType for Content

**Mistake:** SF_MemoryType doesn't match actual content.

**Example:**
- Content: Technical research specifications
- SF_MemoryType: Personal
- Justification: "Oliver personally did the research"

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- MemoryType categorizes CONTENT, not ownership
- Personal means interpersonal/emotional
- Technical means system/specification content

**Fix:**
- Technical: System details, formulations, specifications
- Business: Professional relationships, deals, partnerships
- Personal: Emotional, interpersonal, private experiences
- If technical work has EMOTIONAL content, it's Personal (reaction to work, not the work itself)

### Anti-Pattern 6: SF_Summary That Spoils Choice

**Mistake:** Summary reveals so much that choice becomes obvious.

**Example:**
- SF_Summary: "Proof that Marcus murdered his previous partner in cold blood"
- No moral complexity, obviously should go to Detective

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Eliminates meaningful choice
- Makes Blake vs. Detective obvious
- Removes player agency

**Fix:**
- Summary provides context without dictating choice
- "Evidence of Marcus's previous partnership ending in death"
- Let player discover complexity through content
- Choice emerges from understanding, not summary

### Anti-Pattern 7: Token Content Without Timeline Grounding

**Mistake:** Creating token about event that doesn't exist in Timeline database.

**Example:**
- Token: Sarah's memory of college with Marcus
- Timeline: No event documenting this period
- Character sheet: Doesn't mention college relationship

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Breaks narrative consistency
- Can't cross-reference with other tools
- Creates orphan content

**Fix:**
- ALWAYS check Timeline for grounding event
- If event doesn't exist, create it first
- Ensure other characters mentioned in token are in Timeline event
- Verify character sheet documents this relationship/event

### Anti-Pattern 8: Generic Content

**Mistake:** Token content so vague it could belong to any character.

**Example:**
- "I remember feeling angry about what happened"
- No specifics, no character voice, no cluster alignment

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Doesn't support character development
- No gameplay value (nothing to discover)
- Forgettable, generic

**Fix:**
- Content should be specific to this character
- Include details that ground in Timeline
- Voice should match character database fields
- SF_ fields should align with cluster

## Advanced: Cluster Evolution and Character Arcs

### Can Cluster Membership Change During Gameplay?

**Short Answer:** No. Goal clusters are character identifiers, not player choices.

**Long Answer:**
- Prefix (E-/R-/P-/S-) is part of character NAME
- It identifies core motivation driving PRESENT tense action
- Players make choices, but character goal cluster remains constant
- Player might sell as RECOVERY character, but motivation is still restoration, not profit

**Design Implication:**
- Token content should consistently reflect cluster
- Even when character makes surprising choices, motivation remains
- Voice and framing stay aligned with cluster throughout

### Cluster Complexity and Internal Conflict

While cluster doesn't change, characters CAN experience internal conflict about their motivation.

**Example: COVERUP character questioning whether secret should stay hidden**
- Cluster: COVERUP (motivation is protection)
- Content: Token showing doubt about coverup
- Voice: Still protective, but questioning
- SF_ fields: Still high value (secret still dangerous)
- This adds depth without changing cluster

**Design Rule:** Internal conflict enriches character while maintaining cluster alignment.

## Using This Reference with Other Tools

### Integration with token_design_context_generator.py

When tool outputs character cluster, come to this reference:
1. Read cluster-specific content patterns
2. Check SF_ field patterns
3. Review character database field interpretation
4. Use workflow to design token
5. Verify against anti-patterns

### Integration with sf-mechanics.md

This reference provides CLUSTER context for SF_ fields.
sf-mechanics.md provides VALIDATION rules.

Use both:
1. This reference: What SF_ pattern fits cluster?
2. sf-mechanics.md: Are SF_ fields technically valid?

### Integration with narrative-threads.md

Threads are THEMATIC (what story is told).
Clusters are MOTIVATIONAL (why character cares).

Token needs BOTH:
1. Thread assignment (what story)
2. Cluster framing (character's motivation in that story)

Example:
- Thread: Funding & Espionage
- JUSTICE character: Exposure motivation
- COVERUP character: Protection motivation
- Same thread, different framing

## Reference Maintenance

**When to update this reference:**

**Add examples section:**
- Query existing tokens by cluster
- Analyze SF_ field patterns
- Extract content patterns
- Document successful examples

**Add new patterns:**
- As new tokens are designed, identify successful patterns
- Document patterns that work well
- Add to cluster-specific sections

**Refine anti-patterns:**
- As mistakes are made, document them
- Add to anti-patterns section
- Help future agents avoid same issues

**Update cross-cluster considerations:**
- As complex cases emerge, document them
- Help agents navigate ambiguous situations
- Provide decision frameworks

---

## Quick Decision Framework

**Character has E- prefix:**
→ Read JUSTICE section
→ Focus on evidence, exposure, accountability
→ Business/Technical MemoryType common
→ High value = strong evidence

**Character has R- prefix:**
→ Read RECOVERY section
→ Focus on loss, community, preservation
→ Personal MemoryType dominant
→ High value = identity-defining

**Character has P- prefix:**
→ Read COVERUP section
→ Focus on secrets, protection, complexity
→ All MemoryTypes (depends on secret)
→ High value = destructive if exposed

**Character has S- prefix:**
→ Read PRAGMATIC section
→ Focus on leverage, opportunity, transaction
→ Business MemoryType common
→ High value = literal market value

**Content could fit multiple clusters:**
→ Owner's cluster determines framing
→ Read cross-cluster section
→ Frame content through owner's motivation

**Validating existing token:**
→ Check content aligns with cluster mantra
→ Verify SF_ fields match cluster patterns
→ Confirm voice matches character database
→ Review against anti-patterns

## Summary

Goal clusters provide the motivational framework for token design. Each cluster has distinct:
- Content patterns (what tokens should contain)
- SF_ field patterns (how to set MemoryType, ValueRating, Summary)
- Voice patterns (from character database fields)
- Design workflows (how to create tokens for cluster)

Use this reference when:
- Designing new tokens (identify cluster → follow workflow)
- Validating existing tokens (check alignment with patterns)
- Resolving design ambiguity (cross-cluster considerations)

Remember: Clusters are motivations, not personality types. Characters are complex humans whose motivation drives how they engage with the past and make choices in the present.
