# Evidence Reporting Boundaries

The three-layer evidence model defines what the journalist CAN and CANNOT report based on how evidence was handled during gameplay.

## Layer 1: EXPOSED EVIDENCE (Full Reportability)

Memory tokens submitted to the Detective become PUBLIC RECORD.

**The journalist:**
- CAN quote full memory contents verbatim
- CAN describe what the memory reveals
- CAN draw conclusions from the content
- CAN name who exposed each memory (and credit them)

**These become the FACTS of the article.**

### Correct Examples

> In the memory Alex exposed, we see him presenting his algorithm to Marcus. "This is my life's work," Alex says in the recording.

> James brought the cease and desist letter to my attention. Patchwork Law Firm, representing Alex Chen, demanding NeurAI stop using the stolen algorithm.

> Victoria exposed Jamie's memory. In it, we see Victoria offering Alex the position Marcus held. "He's gone. The job is yours." That's Victoria's voice. Jamie witnessed it.

### What Makes Exposed Evidence Usable

- Someone chose to bring it to the Detective (transparency)
- The content is on the public record
- Attribution matters: name WHO exposed it

---

## Layer 2: BURIED PATTERNS (Observable Only)

Memory tokens sold to the Black Market are PRIVATE. The Valet promised discretion.

### CRITICAL: What's Visible vs Private

**Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
1. Players FIND/UNLOCK memory tokens during the game
2. A token belongs to whoever's memory it contains (the OWNER)
3. Players can SELL any token they find to Blake/Valet (receiving money as incentive)
4. The seller CHOOSES a shell account name for the transaction
5. **Black Market display shows:** Account Name + Total Amount (PUBLIC)
6. **Black Market display does NOT show:** Which tokens/owners contributed (PRIVATE)

**Key Distinction:**
- **Token OWNER** = Whose memory is in the token (e.g., "Kai's memory of...")
- **Transaction OPERATOR** = Who sold the token to Blake (could be anyone who found it)

**What Nova Can See (Public Display):**
- Shell account names (player-chosen pseudonyms like "ChaseT", "Gorlan", "John D.")
- Total dollar amounts per account
- Number of transactions per account (if displayed)
- **Transaction timestamps** (when each burial occurred)
- Who she observed visiting the Valet station (if director noted)

**What Nova CANNOT See:**
- WHOSE memories were sold to each account
- WHO sold specific memories (unless director observed them at Valet)
- Content of buried memories

**The journalist:**
- CAN report shell account names
- CAN report dollar amounts paid
- CAN report timing and sequence patterns
- CAN note suspicious correlations (name patterns like ChaseT = Taylor Chase?)
- CAN report who was OBSERVED at Valet (if director noted)
- CANNOT report whose memories went to which accounts
- CANNOT quote or describe buried memory content
- CANNOT infer specific content from transaction patterns

**These become the MYSTERIES of the article.** The shape of silence, not its contents.

### Correct Examples

> ChaseT received $750,000 across five transactions. Taylor's last name is Chase. That's an interesting choice of account name.

> Gorlan is the largest account: $1.125 million across six transactions. Someone paid a lot to keep something quiet.

> The first burial came at 8:15 PM. $200,000 to Offbeat. I don't know whose memory that was. I know what the silence cost.

> Six different shell accounts. Over $4 million in buried evidence. I can tell you the shape of the silence. I can't tell you what's inside it.

### Director Observation Exception

If the director noted someone at the Valet (e.g., "Taylor was seen selling at 8:15 PM"):
- CAN report that person visited the Valet
- CAN speculate about timing correlation with account activity
- CANNOT know whose MEMORY they were selling (could be their own or someone else's)

### WRONG - Never Do This

> Kai's memories were sold to ChaseT for $750,000.

WHY THIS IS WRONG: We cannot see whose memories went to which accounts. The Black Market display only shows account totals, not individual token ownership.

> Leila's 5 tokens went to Dominic.

WHY THIS IS WRONG: Same issue. We can see "Dominic received $960,000 across 5 transactions" but NOT whose memories those were.

> Victoria buried a memory showing her meeting with Marcus about the algorithm.

WHY THIS IS WRONG: Two violations - we can't know WHO's memory was buried AND we can't know what it contained.

> Derek's buried memories proved he knew about the lab experiments.

WHY THIS IS WRONG: We cannot "prove" anything from buried content. We can only report what we see on the display (account names, totals, timestamps).

> The buried evidence revealed Victoria's involvement in the murder.

WHY THIS IS WRONG: Buried evidence reveals NOTHING about content or ownership. Only patterns of account activity and timing.

### Using Timing + Observation Together (CORRECT)

When director noted someone at Valet AND we see transaction timing:

> I saw Taylor at the Valet station at 8:15 PM. A transaction hit ChaseT at 8:16 PM. Make of that what you will.

This is CORRECT because:
- Director observation = we saw Taylor at Valet (public behavior)
- Transaction timestamp = visible on display
- We're noting correlation, not claiming to know WHOSE memory Taylor sold

### What You CAN Infer vs CANNOT Infer

**CAN infer:**
- Shell account naming patterns (ChaseT = Taylor Chase?)
- Timing clusters (multiple burials in final minutes, first burials at certain times)
- Financial magnitude (someone paid $4.1M to hide things)
- Timing + observation correlations (saw Taylor at Valet at 8:15, transaction at 8:16)
- Account creation patterns (early transactions = likely account creator)

**CANNOT infer:**
- Whose memories went to which accounts (unless observed at Valet)
- What the buried memories showed
- What they prove or disprove
- Specific events or conversations they captured
- Any narrative content whatsoever

## Layer 3: DIRECTOR NOTES (Shapes Focus AND Drives Arc Selection)

Director provides session-specific context that shapes the article's emphasis.

**Sources:**
- The whiteboard (what Cassandra documented during "getting our story straight")
- Director observations (behavior patterns, notable moments)
- The accusation context (who and why)

### CRITICAL: Layer 3 DRIVES Arc Selection

**The whiteboard IS the group's synthesis.** It determines which narrative arcs to prioritize.

```
WRONG (evidence-first approach):
  1. Analyze all exposed evidence
  2. Identify arcs by evidence volume
  3. Rate by "strength" (how much evidence)
  4. Present to user

CORRECT (player-focused approach):
  1. Read whiteboard (Layer 3) FIRST - what did PLAYERS conclude?
  2. Note accusation, suspects, key connections they made
  3. Identify arcs that match PLAYER focus
  4. Find Layer 1 evidence that supports/contradicts each arc
  5. Present arcs in order of PLAYER EMPHASIS, not evidence volume
```

**The article tells the story of THIS GROUP'S investigation, not a generic evidence summary.**

### How Director Notes Shape the Article

**Example: Dec 21 Session**

Whiteboard showed:
- SUSPECTS: Derek (emphasized), Victoria, Morgan
- Key connection: "Victoria + Morgan = permanent solution to Marcus's criminal liability"

This shapes the article to:
- Lead with Victoria/Morgan collusion arc (HIGH player emphasis, on whiteboard)
- Include Derek's suspicious behavior (the group noticed and emphasized him)
- Frame the accusation with the "permanent solution" framing the group developed
- Arcs the group DIDN'T emphasize get LOWER priority regardless of evidence volume

### Player Emphasis Levels

When analyzing arcs, assign emphasis based on whiteboard presence:

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **HIGH** | Explicitly on whiteboard, directly connected to accusation |
| **MEDIUM** | Discussed by group but not central to accusation |
| **LOW** | Supporting context, not player focus |

### What Director Notes Do NOT Do

- They don't replace evidence (still need exposed content to support claims)
- They don't reveal buried content (privacy boundaries still apply)
- They don't override the facts (synthesis, not invention)

---

## Applying Boundaries in Each Section

### THE STORY
- Heavy use of Layer 1 (exposed evidence as narrative facts)
- Light Layer 3 (director notes for emphasis/framing)
- NO Layer 2 content (buried patterns don't belong here)

### FOLLOW THE MONEY
- Heavy Layer 2 patterns (shell accounts, amounts, timing)
- Light Layer 3 (suspicious correlations director noted)
- NO content inference from transactions

### THE PLAYERS
- Mix of Layers 1-3
- Who exposed (Layer 1 + credit)
- Who buried (Layer 2 patterns, no content)
- Behavioral observations (Layer 3)

### WHAT'S MISSING
- Pure Layer 2 (the mysteries)
- Shapes of silence, not contents
- Invitation to wonder, not claims

### CLOSING
- Systemic critique (beyond individual layers)
- The accusation (Layer 3 framing)
- What this means (synthesis)

## Quick Reference: Can I Say This?

| What You Want to Say | Layer | Allowed? |
|---------------------|-------|----------|

| "Victoria buried a memory about the murder" | 2 | NO - can't know content |
| "Victoria paid $450K to bury two memories" | 2 | YES - observable transaction |
| "The group suspected Derek" | 3 | YES - director notes |
| "Derek's buried memory proves guilt" | 2 | NO - can't infer content |
| "James exposed the cease and desist letter" | 1 | YES - attribution + content |
| "ChaseT might be Taylor's account" | 2 | YES - pattern inference |
| "The buried memories revealed the conspiracy" | 2 | NO - buried reveals nothing |
