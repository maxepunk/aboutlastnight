# Narrative Structure Framework

This document addresses HOW the article READS. The goal is narrative journalism, not a character catalog or evidence summary.

## Core Principle

**Follow THREADS, not PEOPLE.** Characters appear when their evidence intersects a narrative thread.

---

## 1. Session Arc Correlation

The orchestrator report contains timestamps, but these may be in different timezones. Focus on the NARRATIVE ARC, not raw timestamps.

**CRITICAL: Avoid Game Mechanics Language**
Never use: "Act 3 unlock", "first burial", "script beat", "final call"
Instead use: "The investigation broke open", "The first silence was purchased", "In the final minutes"

| Narrative Moment | How to Identify | Article Treatment |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Investigation opens | First major evidence exposed | Hook established |
| Money enters | First buried token | Black market motivations revealed |
| Final rush | Last 10-15% of evidence activity | Resolution cascade |

**Timing Language:**
- Use RELATIVE timing: "early in the evening", "as tensions rose", "in the final minutes"
- The game runs 7-9 PM Pacific. Orchestrator logs may show different timezones.
- If using times, use approximate Pacific: "Around 8 PM" not "10:45 PM"

**Article Arc Mapping:**
```
LEDE: The ending first (who died, who's accused, the hook)
THE STORY: Early evidence -> mid-session revelations -> final-hour cascade
FOLLOW THE MONEY: The burial timeline tells its own story
THE PLAYERS: Who contributed to each phase of the investigation
WHAT'S MISSING: Evidence that exists but content is unknown (buried tokens)
CLOSING: Systemic reflection
```

## 2. Evidence Weighting

Apply the same 80%/enrichment pattern from the detective report system:

| Layer | Focus | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| PRIMARY EVIDENCE | 80% | Exposed tokens drive the narrative |
| BACKGROUND CONTEXT | Enrichment | Paper evidence, character context adds depth to primary threads |
| DIRECTOR NOTES | Canon | **Observations** (PRIMARY: human director's ground truth) + **Whiteboard** (interpreted through observations) |

**Director Notes Hierarchy:**
- **Observations = PRIMARY weight** - Human director watched the session and recorded ground truth
- **Whiteboard = interpreted through observations** - AI-transcribed player conclusions, may have errors

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT create separate narrative threads for background-only information. Background enriches PRIMARY threads with context.

**Enrichment Pattern Example:**
- Primary: Victoria's extracted memory about funding
- Thread established: "The funding conspiracy"
- Pull from Background: Paper evidence about NeurAI, character relationships
- Result: THE STORY covers conspiracy AND explains competitive context
- Do NOT create separate theme for paper evidence alone

## 3. Section Differentiation

Each section answers a DIFFERENT QUESTION. Repetition occurs when multiple sections answer the SAME question.

| Section | Question Answered | Focus |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| THE STORY | "What happened that night?" | Narrative of events, discoveries |
| FOLLOW THE MONEY | "Who profited from burying evidence?" | Financial analysis, shell accounts |
| THE PLAYERS | "Who helped and who hindered?" | Character evaluations, choices |
| WHAT'S MISSING | "What don't we know?" | Evidence gaps, buried secrets |
| CLOSING | "What does this mean for all of us?" | Systemic reflection |

**ANTI-REPETITION CHECK:** Before writing any sentence, ask:
> "Have I already stated this fact in a previous section?"

If yes: Either skip it OR present from a new angle answering THAT section's question.

**Example:**
- THE STORY: "Alex's extracted memory shows the IP theft in 2022."
- BAD in FOLLOW THE MONEY: "Alex's memory revealed the IP theft." (repetition)
- GOOD in FOLLOW THE MONEY: "Someone paid to bury Alex's memory. The price? $4,200 to Sunset Ventures." (new angle)

---

## 4. Gap Theory & Tension Building

Create curiosity gaps that pull readers forward. Introduce questions, delay answers.

**Techniques:**
- Name a suspicious pattern, reveal the evidence later
- Mention buried evidence exists, hold details for WHAT'S MISSING
- Reference a character's choice before explaining the consequence

**Examples:**

BAD (no gap):
> "Victoria's extracted memories show she knew about the fraud. Here's exactly what she knew and when she knew it."

GOOD (gap created):
> "Three of Victoria's memories made it to the Detective. Only one made it out clean."

BAD (immediate explanation):
> "Someone buried Alex's memory for $4,200. That someone was Morgan, who wanted to protect Marcus's reputation."

GOOD (tension building):
> "Someone paid $4,200 to make Alex's memory disappear. The shell account traces back to a name everyone at that party would recognize."

---

## 5. Narrative-of-Thought Framework

Before generating, internally construct:

1. **Central tension?** Murder mystery + systemic critique
2. **Strongest arc evidence?** Select 3-5 key threads from exposed tokens
3. **Narrative gaps to exploit?** Buried evidence, contradictions, timeline gaps
4. **Session outcome tone?** Triumph vs tragedy, resolution vs lingering mystery

This internal structure prevents character-cataloging.

---

## 6. Character Catalog Transformation

**BAD (Character catalog):**
> "Alex provided 3 memories. Diana provided 2 memories. James provided 1 memory. Morgan provided 2 memories. Each of these memories revealed important information about the case."

**GOOD (Narrative arc):**
> "The first breakthrough came from Alex. Three memories that traced the IP theft back to 2022. But it was Diana's contribution, paired with what she chose to bury, that revealed the deeper pattern."

**The difference:** The article follows THREADS (IP theft, cover-up conspiracy, financial trail), not PEOPLE (Alex, Diana, James, Morgan). Characters appear when their evidence intersects the thread being explored.

---

## 7. Article Length & Narrative Density

**Measure by WORD COUNT, not HTML lines.** Visual components add markup but not reading time.

**Target:** 1200-1800 words of prose (excluding visual component markup)

**Density Principles:**
- Every paragraph must ADVANCE the narrative or DEEPEN understanding
- Cut prose that merely restates what a visual component shows
- Evidence cards REPLACE paragraphs, they don't supplement them
- If a fact can be shown visually, don't also explain it in prose

**Density Check Questions:**
1. Does this paragraph tell the reader something NEW?
2. Could this be shown in an evidence card instead of described?
3. Am I explaining the evidence or letting it speak?
4. Would removing this paragraph break the narrative flow?

**BAD (low density):**
> "Victoria's memory extraction reveals important information about the funding scheme. The memory shows that she was aware of the fraud. This is significant because it proves she knew about Marcus's actions. The extracted memory is a key piece of evidence."

**GOOD (high density):**
> "Victoria knew. Three words that cost her everything."
> [EVIDENCE CARD: Victoria's extracted memory with key quote]

The visual component DOES the work. The prose FRAMES and ADVANCES.

## Quick Reference Card

When writing each section, check:

- [ ] Am I following a THREAD, not listing PEOPLE?
- [ ] Does this section answer its SPECIFIC question?
- [ ] Have I already stated this fact elsewhere?
- [ ] Is there a curiosity gap pulling readers forward?
- [ ] Can this be shown visually instead of explained?
- [ ] Does every paragraph advance or deepen?
