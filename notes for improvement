-Same for the evidence you'll uncover

-Use this set of visual updates as an opportunity to further enhance the storytelling of this page through subtle and intentional alignment of aesthetic, narrative, and function to create an experience greater than the sum of its parts. Be very intentional and specific about the visual language you use with the animations and collapsed/expanded state visual indicators.
