Short Blurb
"You remember the party. Sort of. Now you're in a room with other guests, all trying to recall what happened. But as memories surface, you realize they might earn you more than just answers. What cost would you bear to uncover the truth?"
Long Description

About last night… You remember that there was a rave in Fremont. A rave thrown by VC darling Marcus Blackwood, CEO of NeurAI. A rave that probably got out of control??

And you remember who you are…. well… you remember your own name, maybe a couple facts about yourself, but everything else is a bit fuzzy and out of reach. 

And now, a detective is telling you that Marcus is dead and asking you all these questions.

Thankfully, there’s puzzles. Solve the puzzles to find your lost memories to figure out who you are. Solve the puzzles to uncover the events of last night. Solve the puzzles to figure out just how much your memories are worth…
Set in a near-future Silicon Valley, this 90-minute immersive experience combines escape room puzzles, social deduction, and strategic trading mechanics. Players embody party-goers, who wake up in a warehouse after a party with fragmented memories and a missing host.
The players not only discover that their memories have been locked up in physical objects they can find throughout the space, but that they have variable worth - both for piecing together the night's events and as valuable commodities that can be traded or sold… 
Players all have backstories that are connected to one another in different ways- some are old friends, others are rivals. Each player has their own puzzle to solve. The memory trading system forces difficult choices about trust and value. Do you return someone's memories out of loyalty to your past friendship? Trade them to the highest bidder? Or use them as leverage to forge new alliances?
Are some memories really worth killing for?

FAQ’s:
Q: What is this?
A: This is an interactive experience where you, as a player, are given a role to play and puzzles to solve to uncover the story of what happened last night at the rave. You and the rest of the players have to decide what you value most as you discover who you are, and how you lost all your memories. We’re taking parts of the experience from murder mysteries, role playing immersive experiences, escape rooms, and strategic trading games. 

Q: Who are you?
A: About Last Night… is written and produced by Shuai Chen of Patchwork Adventures and Max Bora Koknar of Story Punk and is hosted by Off the Couch. Our previous experiences include Order of the Golden Scribe: Initiation Tea, The Riggstone Records, The 300 Locks Game, A Cocktail Party Murder Mystery, The No Ordinary Week Festival, Infernal Motel, Swingposium (with San Jose Taiko & Japantown San Jose), The Map of Now (with Lucky Plush), Chronicles of Lost Lore (with San Mateo County Arts Commission), and the Super Secret Society: a Playable Play. Our games have won industry awards for immersive theater and escape rooms and have been featured on CNN, ABC, The SF Chronicle, and more. 

Q:  Will I be paired with other people?
A: This experience can be played by teams of 5-20. If you don’t have a full team of 20, you might have others join in your game. We know, we know, public booking sucks, but hear us out: this game is designed with some competitive and cooperative gameplay and we think it’s actually better to play with some people you might not know and love. We also have packed a LOT of puzzles into this game and don’t expect any small teams to get to all of them, which will mean you won’t get to uncover all of the narrative points in the world that we created. However, if you would prefer not to play with new friends, there’s an option for blocking out the extra slots when you’re booking.

Q: How long is this?
This experience typically takes teams between 90 minutes and 2 hours. 

Q: Content warning?
A: This experience includes: interaction with actors, interactions with other players, puzzle solving in teams, use of logical deduction and observation skills, mentions of infidelity, artificial intelligence, nepotism in Venture Capital investments, drugs and alcohol, black markets, memory degredation, and commodification of memories.

Memory Becomes Currency in Silicon Valley's First Trading-Based Murder Mystery Award-winning creators behind Golden Lock winner launch "About Last Night..." where tech culture meets immersive theater at an escape room.
FREMONT, Calif. (October [X], 2025) — In a near-future Silicon Valley where memories can be extracted and traded, participants must decide what their past is worth. About Last Night..., a groundbreaking 90-minute experience merging escape rooms with memory trading mechanics, opens October 18, 2025 at Off the Couch Games in Fremont.
Created by MIT neuroscientist Shuai Chen, whose Order of the Golden Scribe won the industry's highest honors, and theater innovator Bora "Max" Koknar, creator of the first AI co-written play in U.S. theater, the experience places 5-20 participants in the aftermath of a tech CEO's suspicious death. Players discover their memories of the previous night's rave have been locked in physical objects that can be solved, stolen, or sold.
"We wanted to explore what happens when the most intimate parts of ourselves become commodities," said [Chen or Koknar with full title]. "In an era where tech companies already trade in our personal data, we're asking participants to literally negotiate the value of their memories."
The experience draws inspiration from Jubensha, Chinese murder mystery games emphasizing heavy roleplay, while incorporating distinctly Silicon Valley themes of venture capital, artificial intelligence, and the commodification of human experience. Each participant receives a unique character with connections to others - some as allies, others as rivals - forcing difficult choices about trust, loyalty, and the price of truth.
