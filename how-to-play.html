            <p>That's the loop. But you're not alone in it.</p>

            <p>Others are unlocking memories too — about themselves, about you, about what really happened to Marcus... Furthermore some puzzles require you to get information that only others know.</p>

            <p>What is found, what is shared, what is hidden... all of that <span class="corrupt">is</span> the game.</p>

            <p>Want Justice? Profit? Secrecy? The choice is yours–but the group must get their story straight before the cops arrive.</p>
