            <p><strong>Unlock Memories</strong> — Marcus' 'lockdown protocol' has left evidence and extracted memories locked up all around the warehouse. Puzzle through how to get past the locks.</p>

            <p><strong>Scan Their Contents</strong> — Read the contents of the extracted memories using one of Marcus' memory display scanner prototypes.</p>

            <p><strong>Decide Their Fate</strong> — Memory tokens are your currency. Once you know the contents of one, you get to decide what to do:</p>
			
        <div class="faq-grid" style="margin: 2rem 0;">

                    <p><strong>Turning in evidence:</strong></p>
                    <p>• <strong>Anonymous tip:</strong> Nobody needs to know you were the one to expose this memory</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Take credit:</strong> The public will know you were the source for this piece of evidence</p>

					<p><strong>Shell account -</strong></p>
                    <p>• ANONYMOUS offshore account</p>
                    <p>• You CHOOSE the ACCOUNT NAME</p>
                    <p>• Shell accounts MAY be SHARED by MULTIPLE individuals</p>

            <p>That's the loop. But you're not alone in it.</p>

            <p>Others are unlocking memories too — about themselves, about you, about what really happened to Marcus. Not to mention, some puzzles require you to get information only others have access to.</p>

            <p>What is found, what is shared, what is hidden... all of that <em>is</em> the game.</p>

            <p><strong>Negotiate</strong> — What's the story YOU want the world to find out About Last Night?</p>

            <p>Want Justice? Profit? Secrecy? The choice is yours–but the group must get their story straight before the cops arrive.</p>

            <p>Well, that and the incentives offered by NPCs: Expose your alibi to the public, embarrassing as it may be, and you're off the hook. Bury the right secrets, and you may become the next face of NeurAI...</p>

            <p><em>The clock is always running.</em></p>
