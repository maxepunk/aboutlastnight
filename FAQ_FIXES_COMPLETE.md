# FAQ Section Restoration - November 16, 2024

## The Problem
The FAQ section was failing its core purpose: **removing friction from the booking decision**. In our pursuit of maintaining the noir atmosphere, we had obscured critical information that people need to make a purchase decision.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Restored Pricing Information** ✅
**Before:** No price mentioned anywhere in FAQ
**After:** Clear pricing: "$75 per person for all October performances"
**Why This Matters:** Price is the #1 question. Hiding it kills conversions.

### 2. **Fixed the Header** ✅
**Before:** "Classified Intel" / "Answers to questions you didn't know you had"
**After:** "Before You Enter: Essential Intel" / "Real answers to real questions"
**Why This Matters:** FAQ seekers want clarity, not more mystery

### 3. **Added Missing Essential Questions** ✅
Added 5 critical questions that were completely missing:
- **How much does it cost?** → $75 per person
- **When and where?** → Off the Couch Games, Fremont + dates
- **How do I book?** → Join preview list for early access
- **What about parking?** → Free parking available
- **What should I know before coming?** → Practical preparation info

### 4. **Improved Transition** ✅
**Before:** "Trust them with your memories?" (too vague)
**After:** "Still have questions?" (clear and direct)

## The Result

The FAQ now successfully serves its purpose:

### Information Architecture
- **Practical questions** answered clearly
- **Booking barriers** removed
- **Logistics** clarified
- **Concerns** addressed

### Maintains Balance
- Still has noir flavor in headers
- But prioritizes **clarity over cleverness**
- Real answers to real questions
- No unnecessary mystery where it hurts conversion

## FAQ Content Now Covers:

1. ✅ **What it is** - Clear explanation
2. ✅ **Group size** - 5-20 players
3. ✅ **Stranger pairing** - Honest about public booking
4. ✅ **Duration** - 90-120 minutes
5. ✅ **PRICE** - $75 per person (RESTORED!)
6. ✅ **LOCATION** - Off the Couch Games, Fremont (ADDED!)
7. ✅ **DATES** - October 4-12, 18-Nov 9 (CLARIFIED!)
8. ✅ **Scary factor** - Not horror, noir mystery
9. ✅ **Preparation** - What to wear/expect (ADDED!)
10. ✅ **Age** - 16+ recommended
11. ✅ **Content warnings** - Full disclosure
12. ✅ **HOW TO BOOK** - Clear next steps (ADDED!)
13. ✅ **PARKING** - Free, plus transit options (ADDED!)

## Why This Matters

The FAQ is the **trust-building section** where people come to have their concerns addressed before committing $75. It needs to:
- Remove confusion
- Build confidence
- Provide practical details
- Enable decision-making

**The immersive noir experience is the product. The FAQ is the instruction manual.**

## Design Principle

While the rest of the page asks questions to build intrigue, the FAQ must **answer questions to enable action**. It's the one section where clarity trumps atmosphere - and that's exactly what makes it effective within the larger journey.
