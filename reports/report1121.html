<h1>Case Report: "About Last Night"</h1>

<div class="meta">
    <strong>CASE ID:</strong> MC-2025-1121<br>
    <strong>DATE:</strong> 2027-02-21<br>
    <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Blackwood Warehouse (Sector 4)<br>
    <strong>STATUS:</strong> ACTIVE MANHUNT<br>
    <strong>REPORTING OFFICER:</strong> DET. ANONDONO
</div>

<h2>// EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>
    Marcus Blackwood is dead. That’s the headline, but it’s the least interesting part of the story. The CEO of NeurAI hosted a party to celebrate the future, but the only thing being served was a cocktail of memory-suppressants and corporate betrayal.
</p>
<p>
    The perpetrator has been identified as "Blake Manley"—a cleaner for the underground syndicate known as <strong>The Black Market</strong>. Manley didn't just crash the party; he orchestrated a mass extraction event. The guests lost time. Marcus lost his life.
</p>
<p>
    It appears Marcus attempted a double-cross. He locked his associates' extracted memories in around the venue—collateral, perhaps? Or a fail-safe? And why puzzles? Did he think he was oh-so-clever? Regardless. it didn't save him. Manley executed Blackwood to tie up loose ends and attempted to hold some of the guests hostage in exchange for the memories he was looking to recover. Thanks to the intervention of the "sleepyheads", especially the investigative work of journalist <strong>Ashe Motoko</strong>, the location of the hostages was pinpointed near Canyon Road.
</p>
<p>
    We recovered the hostages. We recovered the memories. But Blake Manley is in the wind.
</p>

<h2>// EVIDENCE LOCKER: PHYSICAL ASSETS</h2>
<p>The warehouse was littered with the debris of broken lives and white-collar crimes. We didn't just find drugs; we found the motive.</p>

<div class="evidence-item">
    <strong>The Corporate Shell Game:</strong>
    Documents recovered on site—specifically <em>Company One-Pagers</em> and <em>Funding Emails</em>—paint a clear picture. Marcus was bleeding money. Emails between <strong>James Whitman</strong> and <strong>Victoria</strong> confirm that funding for NeurAI was contingent on technology that Marcus didn't actually possess.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
    <strong>The Fraud:</strong>
    A <em>Cease & Desist letter</em> and <em>Alex’s Character Sheet</em> reveal the ugly truth: Marcus didn't write the code. <strong>Alex</strong> did. Marcus was the face, Alex was the brain, and James was the wallet getting squeezed.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
    <strong>The "Chemist":</strong>
    We found texts between Marcus and a known associate, <strong>Derek</strong>. Marcus wasn't just buying party favors; he was putting a drug dealer on the payroll as an "in-house chemist." The budget proposals confirm it. This is how they synthesized the memory agents used on the guests.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
    <strong>The Cover-Up:</strong>
    <strong>Taylor Chase</strong> sent an email confirming the burial of an exposé written by Ashe Motoko. They've ALWAYS known the memory experiments were dangerous, and they silenced the press to keep their valuation up.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
    <strong>Domestic Decay:</strong>
    It wasn't just business. <em>Divorce emails from Diana</em>, a <em>Paternity Test</em> for <strong>Jessicah Kane</strong> (99.85% positive), and receipt of expensive jewelry for <strong>Sarah</strong> tell the story of a man whose personal life was as fraudulent as his business.
</div>

<h2>// MEMORY ANALYSIS: THE TOKENS</h2>
<p>
    Blake Manley lied. He told the victims the tokens were ticking time bombs. He wanted them desperate. We proved that the tokens were merely vessels—waiting to restore the data to the host. Once we cracked the locks, the memories sang like canaries.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>ALR001 (Alex's Memory):</strong> Visual confirmation that Alex rebuilt Marcus’s broken algorithm from scratch. Marcus was incompetent; Alex was the genius.</li>
    <li><strong>DIN021 (Diana's Memory):</strong> Audio of <strong>Morgan Reed</strong> threatening Marcus with proof of bribes. The walls were closing in from the legal department.</li>
    <li><strong>RAT031 (Rachel's Voice Memo):</strong> A drunken confession implicating Marcus in criminal dealings involving shell vehicles. This connects Blackwood directly to money laundering.</li>
    <li><strong>ASM042 (Ashe's Memory):</strong> A suppressed memory of Ashe being forced to settle and kill her story. This was the smoking gun for the motive behind the hostility toward the journalist.</li>
    <li><strong>MAB001 (The Expiration Lie):</strong> Marcus’s own notes confirming that "expiration" simply meant the memory returned to the owner. Blake used this ignorance to control the room.</li>
</ul>

<h2>// SUSPECT NETWORK & ASSOCIATES</h2>

<p><strong>MARCUS BLACKWOOD (DECEASED):</strong> Founder. Fraud. Father (to more children than he admitted). He built a house of cards on stolen code and hush money. He invited the Black Market in, and they collected his debt in blood.</p>

<p><strong>"BLAKE MANLEY" (AT LARGE):</strong> Black Market enforcer. Charismatic, dangerous, and pragmatic. He realized Marcus was a liability. When the extraction plan went sideways, he cut his losses (and Marcus's throat) and vanished.</p>

<p><strong>ASHE MOTOKO (WITNESS/ASSET):</strong> Former SVBJ journalist. Initially silenced, now vindicated. Her research was instrumental in locating the hostages. She is currently under protective surveillance.</p>

<p><strong> THE OLD PARTNERS (James, Alex, Victoria):</strong> Former friends turned bitter rivals. They all had motives to kill Marcus, but the evidence suggests they were pawns in Blake's game this time. They’ve been cleared of the homicide, but the SEC will have a field day with the fraud evidence we uncovered.</p>

<p><strong>DEREK & JESSICAH:</strong> The drug connection and the mistress. Both were leveraged by Marcus. Jessicah was paid off with a $50,000 check (voided) to keep the pregnancy quiet.</p>

<h2>// OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>
    We won the battle, but the war is just starting.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Where is Blake Manley?</strong> He left the warehouse before our tac-teams breached. He has the resources of the Black Market behind him. He will resurface.</li>
    <li><strong>The Data Leak:</strong> Marcus’s shell companies were funneling money somewhere. Was it just to the Black Market, or is there a third party involved in the memory tech development?</li>
    <li><strong>The "Unicorn":</strong> Texts between Derek and Marcus mention a "unicorn." Is this a person, a new drug variant, or simply yet another Silicon Valley tech bro dream of building a billion dollar company?</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p class="note">
    <strong>DETECTIVE'S NOTE:</strong>
    To the civilians who stepped up: You did good. You didn't let Blake sell your pasts to the highest bidder. Go home, hug your loved ones, and maybe write down your passwords. In this town, your memory is the only currency that matters—and everyone is trying to pick your pocket.
