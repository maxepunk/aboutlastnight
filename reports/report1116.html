    <h1>Official Case Report</h1>

    <div class="meta-data">
        <strong>CASE ID:</strong> MC-2025-1116<br>
        <strong>DATE:</strong> 2027-02-22<br>
        <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Abandoned Warehouse (Venue of most recent 'Blackwood Rave')<br>
        <strong>REPORTING OFFICER:</strong> Det. Anondono<br>
        <strong>STATUS:</strong> SUSPECT AT LARGE
    </div>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Marcus Blackwood</strong> died at the hands of his own business partner—the Black Market operative using the alias <strong>Blake Manley</strong>. The hostages were recovered through negotiated cooperation with the killer, who subsequently fled when exposed. This group uncovered the human cost of <strong>Marcus's</strong> empire: stolen genius, broken promises, and a trail of people he used until they had nothing left to give. They chose to save lives over building a case. The memories they recovered tell the story of a man who took everything and gave nothing back.</p>

<h2>Evidence Locker</h2>

<div class="evidence-item">
<strong>The Theft That Built An Empire:</strong> Recovered memories from <strong>Alex Reeves</strong> expose the foundational lie of <strong>Marcus Blackwood's</strong> success. On May 12, 2022, <strong>Alex</strong> discovered <strong>Marcus's</strong> revolutionary BizAI algorithm—the product that launched his entire corporate empire—was fundamentally broken. Didn't work. Never had. <strong>Alex</strong> rebuilt the entire system by sunrise, alone in the office while <strong>Marcus</strong> slept off whatever he'd been celebrating. Years later, at 11:32PM on the night of his death, another extracted memory shows <strong>Alex</strong> finally snapping—physically attacking <strong>Marcus</strong> in the kind of rage that comes from watching someone else get rich off your genius. The assault was bottled fury released, years of stolen work and phantom equity finally demanding payment. <strong>Marcus</strong> built his kingdom on someone else's code and called it innovation.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
<strong>The Women He Discarded:</strong> Memory extractions from <strong>Jessicah Kane</strong> paint a picture of <strong>Marcus's</strong> cruelty in intimate detail. At 9:20PM, captured in a memory witnessed by <strong>Howie</strong>, <strong>Jessicah</strong> confronted <strong>Marcus</strong> about their baby—and he blew her off mid-conversation like she was interrupting something important. Hours later, at 3:36AM in the early morning hours before his death, a different memory shows <strong>Jessicah</strong> and <strong>Sarah</strong> discovering they'd both been victimized by the same man. What should have been a moment of rivalry became unexpected solidarity—two women finding compassion in shared trauma, piecing together the pattern of a predator who took what he wanted and walked away.
</div>

<div class="evidence-item">
<strong>Casual Cruelty:</strong> An audio extraction from <strong>Ashe Motoko</strong> captures <strong>Marcus</strong> at 11:30PM, insulting <strong>Kai</strong> in the middle of his own party—disrespectful, dismissive, the kind of behavior that doesn't even register as cruelty to the person doing it. Just <strong>Marcus</strong> being <strong>Marcus</strong>. Another name on the list of people he stepped on without looking down.
</div>

<h2>Memory Analysis</h2>

<p>The memory tokens recovered from this scene were extracted using Black Market neural scanning technology—the same tech that left the partygoers with gaps in their timelines and <strong>Marcus Blackwood</strong> dead on the floor. Extraction is non-destructive when done right, but the Black Market doesn't do things right. They dose, they scan, they lock the memories in encrypted tokens, and they sell the intel to whoever's buying.</p>

<p>The five extractions form a timeline of escalation. The earliest—<strong>Alex's</strong> May 2022 discovery—captures the foundational theft that built <strong>Marcus's</strong> empire. By the night of the incident, that exploitation had bred violence: <strong>Alex's</strong> 11:32PM assault proves how years of stolen work eventually demand payment.</p>

<p>The later memories document <strong>Marcus's</strong> pattern beyond business. <strong>Jessicah</strong> confronted at 9:20PM and dismissed mid-sentence. <strong>Sarah</strong> and <strong>Jessicah</strong> at 3:36AM, discovering they're part of the same pattern. Even the 11:30PM audio—<strong>Marcus</strong> insulting <strong>Kai</strong> casually, like it costs nothing—shows how normalized the cruelty had become.</p>

<p>Multiple witnesses, independent extractions, years of consistent behavior. The memories don't just document individual incidents—they prove a methodology.</p>

<h2>Suspect Network</h2>

<p><strong>Blake Manley (alias):</strong> The Black Market operative who killed <strong>Marcus Blackwood</strong> to tie up loose ends after their partnership collapsed. Took hostages to force cooperation. Lied about memory token expiration to manipulate the negotiation. Fled when exposed. Still at large. Dangerous, organized, and very good at disappearing.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Reeves:</strong> The obvious suspect until the timeline cleared him. Motive: years of stolen genius turned into someone else's fortune. Means: close access to <strong>Marcus</strong>. The 11:32PM memory proves violent capability—he attacked <strong>Marcus</strong> that night, rage finally finding an outlet. But assault isn't murder. The extraction shows a beating, not a killing, and the timing doesn't match <strong>Marcus's</strong> death. <strong>Alex</strong> had every reason; someone else had the opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Jessicah Kane &amp; Sarah:</strong> Two women who discovered they were part of the same pattern. <strong>Jessicah</strong>, pregnant and dismissed mid-conversation. <strong>Sarah</strong>, another victim in <strong>Marcus's</strong> wake. Their 3:36AM solidarity shows trauma processing, not conspiracy—women choosing compassion over rivalry. They document <strong>Marcus's</strong> pattern with women, but nothing in their memories suggests murder. They're witnesses to a predator's methodology.</p>

<p><strong>Ashe Motoko:</strong> Witnessed <strong>Marcus's</strong> casual cruelty toward <strong>Kai</strong>—another data point in the pattern, not a suspect.</p>

<h2>Outstanding Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Who secured the memory tokens behind combination locks before the murder—<strong>Marcus</strong> in a double-cross, or <strong>Blake</strong> in an elaborate setup?</li>
<li>What exactly triggered the fatal altercation between <strong>Marcus</strong> and <strong>Blake</strong>? Business dispute, betrayal, or something more personal?</li>
<li>How many other victims are out there—people <strong>Marcus</strong> exploited who never got their memories extracted, never got their stories told?</li>
<li>What was <strong>Blake's</strong> endgame? Did he plan the murder, or was it improvisation when things went wrong?</li>
<li>Where is <strong>Blake Manley</strong> now, and what name is he using?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Assessment</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>This group made a choice I don't agree with, but I understand it. They had evidence that could crack the Black Market wide open—memory extractions, documented patterns, proof of exploitation—and they traded it away to save lives. <strong>Sofia</strong> spent the entire investigation documenting everyone's stories. <strong>Jamie</strong> collected tokens and held onto them. Together, they pieced together the narrative and shared it with the group before the final negotiation. Then they chose hostages over justice.</p>

<p>I can't fault them for valuing breathing people over a case file. That's the calculus that keeps you human in this work. But now <strong>Blake Manley</strong> is gone, the Black Market gets another day in business, and the only evidence we have is what I pulled from memory extractions before they walked away.</p>

<p>Now <strong>Blake's</strong> in the wind, and the Black Market keeps operating. The hostages are home, but the system that made this possible is still running. That's the trade-off—some days you save lives, other days you dismantle networks. Rarely both.</p>

<p>The choice they made—hostages over evidence—means <strong>Blake Manley</strong> gets to kill again somewhere else, under some other name. That's the cost. I'll carry that into the next case, and the one after. The Black Market doesn't sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Case Status:</strong> Homicide solved (suspect identified, at large). Black Market investigation ongoing. Hostages recovered. Evidence chain compromised by negotiated cooperation. <strong>Blake Manley</strong> - wanted for murder, memory trafficking, and making me wish I'd gotten here five minutes earlier.</p>
