    <h1>Official Case Report</h1>

    <div class="meta-data">
        <strong>CASE ID:</strong> MC-2025-1116<br>
        <strong>DATE:</strong> 2027-02-21<br>
        <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Blackwood Residence / "The Party"<br>
        <strong>REPORTING OFFICER:</strong> Det. Anondono<br>
        <strong>STATUS:</strong> <span style="color:#c0392b">ACTIVE MANHUNT</span>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Marcus Blackwood is dead. The call went out before dawn, but the groundwork was laid years ago. When I arrived on the scene, the body was cold, but the room was still warm with the friction of betrayal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The initial assessment suggested a chaotic domestic dispute or corporate espionage gone wrong. The truth is heavier. Blackwood was liquidated by <strong>Blake</strong>, a cleaner for the underground organization known as "The Black Market." Blackwood, in his infinite arrogance, likely tried to double-cross the hand that fed him his illicit memory drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The guests—witnesses, victims, suspects, take your pick—were dosed with amnestics. Missing time. Missing memories. While they were under, their secrets were extracted and locked in boxes scattered around the venue like party favors from hell. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We recovered the hostages from a warehouse near Canyon Road, but the price was high. The witnesses opted to negotiate with the terrorists, handing over the extracted memory tokens to secure the release of the captives. A life for a memory. It’s the kind of math that keeps me up at night. Blake is in the wind.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Evidence Locker</h2>
    <p>
        The crime scene was a monument to Blackwood's failures. We didn't just find fingerprints; we found the debris of destroyed lives.
    </p>

    <h3>The Corporate facade</h3>
    <p>
        The financial trail paints a picture of a sinking ship. We found <strong>Company One-Pagers</strong> for both James and Marcus, detailing a bitter funding war for Victoria's capital. <strong>Cease & Desist letters</strong> and emails between James and Alex confirm that NeurAI was built on stolen ground. Marcus didn't write the code; he stole it from Alex. The <strong>"Stanford Four" photograph</strong> found on site shows the old crew before the money rotted them from the inside out.
    </p>

    <h3>The Domestic Wreckage</h3>
    <p>
        Sarah Blackwood wasn't just a grieving widow; she was a woman looking for an exit. We found <strong>texts to her friend Rachel</strong> detailing "changes" in Marcus and a <strong>loyalty card</strong> listing years of grievances. More damning? A note regarding a <strong>prenup loophole</strong>. But Marcus was busy, too. 
    </p>

    <h3>The Smoking Gun (Biological)</h3>
    <p>
        Hidden under the panda at the scene: a <strong>Paternity Test</strong>. 99.85% probability. Marcus was the father of Jessicah Kane's unborn child. Nearby, a <strong>voided severance check</strong> for $50,000 addressed to Jessicah with a "confidentiality clause" in the memo line. He tried to buy his own child's silence with a check he didn't even sign.
    </p>

    <h3>The Black Market Connection</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Derek's texts </strong> confirm he was the pipeline. Marcus wanted Derek on the payroll as an "in-house chemist"—a fancy title for a drug cook. We found <strong>budget proposals</strong> hiding this line item. This wasn't just a party; it was a distribution hub.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Memory Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The physical evidence tells us <em>how</em> things broke. The memory tokens tell us <em>why</em>. These digital engrams were extracted from the guests, likely by Blake or his associates, to be used as leverage.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ALR001 & ALR002 (Alex's Memories):</strong> These tokens confirm the motive for hatred. Alex rebuilt Marcus's broken algorithm from scratch. The second memory depicts Alex physically assaulting Marcus. It’s pure, distilled rage. In a standard investigation, this makes Alex the prime suspect. Here? It just makes him another victim of Marcus's theft.</li>
        <li><strong>JEK002 & JEK031 (Jessicah's Memories):</strong> Tragic. One token shows Jessicah and Sarah bonding over their victimization. The other shows Marcus blowing off Jessicah regarding the pregnancy. He treated people like disposable code.</li>
        <li><strong>ASM031 (Ashe's Memory):</strong> A recording of Marcus abusing Kai. It establishes a pattern of behavior. Marcus wasn't just a bad businessman; he was a bad man.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Suspect Network</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone in the room had a motive. That’s why Blake’s plan worked so well. He hid a professional hit inside a room full of amateurs who all wanted the target dead.
    </p>
    
    <div class="evidence-item">
        <strong>THE DECEASED: Marcus Blackwood.</strong> CEO, fraud, adulterer. Stole Alex's work, cheated on Sarah, impregnated Jessicah, and tried to double-cross a crime syndicate.
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-item">
        <strong>THE PERPETRATOR: Blake.</strong> Black Market representative. Ruthless. Efficient. Used the partygoers' own secrets to distract them while he cleaned house. Current location: Unknown.
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-item">
        <strong>THE RIVAL: James Whitman.</strong> Emails prove he was getting shafted in the deal with Victoria. He hated Marcus for screwing over Alex. He had the motive and the opportunity, but lacked the killer instinct.
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-item">
        <strong>THE GHOST WRITER: Alex.</strong> The true genius behind NeurAI. The hidden code in the Cease & Desist letter was likely his desperate cry for help. He had the most to gain from Marcus's death—reclaiming his life's work.
    </div>

    <div class="evidence-item">
        <strong>THE DEALER: Derek.</strong> The link to the drugs. Marcus was squeezing him to go corporate. If Derek talked, the Black Market would have stepped in. Which is exactly what happened.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Outstanding Questions</h2>
    <p>
        The hostages are safe, and the immediate threat is neutralized. But we don't close files just because the bodies are buried.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Where is the money?</strong> Texts between "Flip" and his bookie mention a hidden money location. Marcus had shell vehicles and offshore accounts. That cash is still out there.</li>
        <li><strong>The Memory Tech:</strong> With Marcus dead and the lab exposed, what happens to the "Sparking Genius" methodology? This tech is too dangerous to be left in the wild.</li>
        <li><strong>Blake's Next Move:</strong> He didn't just kill Marcus; he secured many of the tokens. Even though some were held back by the witnesses, the Black Market has data on everyone in that room. This isn't over. They are watching.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
        <strong>DETECTIVE'S NOTE:</strong> This investigation was a puzzle, but the real mystery is how these people sleep at night. We dug up the truth, but I have a feeling we only scratched the surface of the Black Market. Stay sharp.
