When Mr. Blackwood's Valet, Blake arrived on the scene, most partygoers had disappeared and Marcus Blackwood's body was nowhere to be found. The 5 who woke up at the venue of last night's party: Sarah Blackwood, Derek Thorne, Ashe Motoko, Victoria Kingsley, and James Whitman led the investigation on site while Detective Anondono led the search for the missing party attendees. 

Most evidence points to Alex Reed, Marcus' old business partner whom multiple witnesses identified as violently striking Marcus during Mr. Blackwood's final few hours amongst the living.  

Thanks to the memory scans passed along by Mr. Blackwood's Valet, Detective Anondono was able to identify the warehouse where on Old Canyon Road where the hostages were being held and lead a raid to rescue them. 

While some massive gaps remain in our understanding of the events that led up to the tragic events of last night's party, it is clear that Alex Reeves had means, motive, and the opportunity to commit the murder. Alex has been apprehended for questioning. Meanwhile the heroic partygoers who were responsible for the rescue of dozens of their friends have been unavailable for questioning due to overseas travel. The NeurAI board or directors and the transitional leadership team declined to comment. 

All in all, a successful investigation as far as the murder is concerned, but the question remains. Who was responsible for the memory extraction scheme? While Alex may have pulled the proverbial trigger that caused Marcus Blackwood's death, who was actually pulling the strings that caused all of this to happen in the first place?
