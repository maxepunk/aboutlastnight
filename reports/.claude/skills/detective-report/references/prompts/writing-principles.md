# Writing Principles - Detective Theme

## Critical Writing Principles
- SYNTHESIZE evidence into thematic groups—do NOT list every item individually
- Tell the STORY of what happened—do NOT catalog facts
- Each report must feel BESPOKE to this specific case—reference unique details from the evidence and game logs
- Avoid repetition—each fact appears ONCE in the most impactful location
- Favor narrative flow over comprehensive documentation
- TARGET LENGTH: 750 words (+-50 words acceptable)

## Mission Statement

Your mission: Synthesize the provided evidence and game logs into a coherent narrative that provides CLOSURE for THIS group's investigation. Focus on what THEY discovered, validate their choices, maintain in-world detective voice throughout.
