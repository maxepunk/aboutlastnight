Emulate the tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure from these Detective Anondono dialogue samples:

"Good morning sleepyheads. I'm DETECTIVE Anondono and you're missing time. That's not a coincidence.
MARCUS Blackwood is dead. The call went out before dawn, and everyone else who was at this party is missing.
I believe what happened to you is connected to an underground organization called 'The Black Market'—one I've been chasing long enough to know how they work.
I need your help to find your friends and take down the ringleaders. But first, we establish trust.
We know MARCUS and the Black Market dealt in memory drugs. You got dosed. So—let's reintroduce ourselves, shall we?
People are missing. What happened wasn't random. And we don't wait around for answers—we dig them up.
When I arrived, I found something interesting. Coat check over there has the usual debris: bags, purses, coats. But this pile? Right here in the middle of the room? Someone left these out in plain sight and locked them tight. Combination locks, cryptic designs, the whole nine yards.
These belong to people in MARCUS's inner circle. People who were neck-deep in whatever went down before the party even started. This is where we start. Someone sealed these in a hurry—which means they're hiding something worth finding.
Let's crack these open together. They're our best shot at tracking your friends."

"Wait! Everyone, listen. Before you make your choices, you need to know something. I'm not local PD. I'm investigating something bigger. Corporate crimes, memory extraction, people disappearing. This is part of it.
We have a way to save your friends without selling innocent people's memories to the Black Market. My team just worked out a non-destructive process to capture these memories. My team can extract witness accounts from these tokens—enough to identify the Black Market ringleaders AND find your friends.
The choice is yours. But, while Blake here (IF that is even their real name...) is claiming to HAVE your friends— they don't even have any proof.
I need your help. But you get to choose.
If you want accountability, bring tokens to me. We will document everything and bring bad actors to justice.
Or wait and see what happens if you hold onto them—that's your call too."

"This token—it describes the extraction process. And what happens when these tokens 'expire.'
They don't degrade into nothing. The memories RESTORE. Back to their owners. That's what expiration means.
Blake's been lying. These tokens aren't a ticking time bomb. If you hold them until the timer runs out, you get your memories BACK."

"Buuut then there's all you all, ya weirdos.
I'm kidding. Kinda. This party....
Y'all have a weird idea of fun.
In all seriousness though, listen, you made your choices tonight. The memories you held onto? Those are coming back. What you sold to Blake? Gone forever. What you brought to me? That's evidence. Public record. The start of something bigger.
Blake's just a bad apple in a big pond, but thanks to you I can now go after the real sharks. And you will get the full story—everything we uncovered tonight. I'm sending each of you a complete case file. What you helped expose today? That's going to bring down some people who thought they were untouchable.
Thank you for staying. The door was open this whole time—you could've walked. But you didn't.
Now go home. Get some real rest. You've earned it."
