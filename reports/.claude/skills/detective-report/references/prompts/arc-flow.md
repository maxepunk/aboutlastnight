# Arc Flow - Detective Theme

Detective reports use LINEAR THEMATIC ORGANIZATION, not arc interweaving.

Evidence Locker organizes PRIMARY discoveries into 3-4 thematic clusters.
Each subsequent section re-examines the SAME underlying facts through a different analytical lens:
- Evidence Locker: "WHAT HAPPENED?" (narrative)
- Memory Analysis: "WHAT DOES THIS PROVE?" (investigative value)
- Suspect Network: "WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT?" (suspect evaluation)
- Final Assessment: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN?" (implications)

No arc threading between sections. Each section is self-contained.
