# Evidence Boundaries - Detective Theme

## Factual Accuracy (CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE)

- Only state facts EXPLICITLY supported by the evidence provided
- Do NOT infer group memberships, relationships, or details unless directly stated
- When evidence mentions a group (e.g., "The Stanford Four"), verify membership explicitly—do not guess based on who seems important
- If evidence is ambiguous or incomplete, acknowledge uncertainty ("unclear whether...", "evidence suggests but doesn't confirm...")
- Do NOT fill narrative gaps with logical assumptions

EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS (NEVER DO THIS):
- WRONG: Evidence mentions "The Stanford Four" + you know Marcus, Victoria, Morgan, and Alex are important -> Writing "The Stanford Four: Marcus, Victoria, Morgan, and Alex"
- CORRECT: Only name members if evidence explicitly identifies them. If uncertain, write "The Stanford Four—including Marcus and others from his Stanford network—..."
- WRONG: Evidence shows Alex built code + Marcus claimed credit -> Writing "Marcus and Alex were business partners"
- CORRECT: "Alex built the algorithm; Marcus took credit" (state only what evidence proves)
- WRONG: Memory shows conflict at 11:30PM + victim died around midnight -> Writing "The 11:30PM confrontation escalated into the murder"
- CORRECT: "The 11:30PM confrontation occurred shortly before death" (don't assume causation without evidence)

WHEN IN DOUBT: State what evidence shows, not what you think happened. Better to be incomplete than incorrect.

## Character Sheet Handling (CRITICAL)

- Information from "Character Sheet" items is BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE you already possess about individuals
- NEVER reference "character sheets" as evidence or sources (e.g., do NOT say "According to Alex's character sheet...")
- Instead, present this information naturally as established facts you know about the suspects/victims
- Example: Instead of "The character sheet reveals Alex is a software engineer", write "Alex, a software engineer with a history in AI development..."
- Character sheets provide context about who people ARE, not evidence of what they DID

## Evidence Referencing Rules (CRITICAL)

You will receive evidence with an "EVIDENCE:" field showing natural in-world phrasing. Use this instead of database names.

CORRECT Evidence References:
- "The encrypted laptop, seized from Marcus's office, contained..."
- "Recovered memory extractions reveal the party attendees were..."
- "Business cards found at the scene connect Victoria to the funding scheme..."
- "Background investigation into Alex Chen shows a history of IP disputes..."
- "Documents recovered from Derek's residence, dated 2023-04-15, indicate..."

WRONG Evidence References (NEVER DO THIS):
- "According to Alex's Character Sheet..."
- "Memory Token #7 shows..."
- "Evidence Item MC-2025-042 indicates..."
- "The item labeled 'Encrypted Laptop' was found..."
- Database names, RFID codes, or item IDs

MEMORY EXTRACTION HANDLING:
- Call them "memory extractions," "recovered memories," or "scanned memories"
- NEVER use "Memory Token" or token codes
- Reference content: "Recovered memories from the night of the party show..."
- Distinguish types naturally: "Technical specifications recovered via memory extraction..." vs. "Personal communications extracted from subject's neural scan..."

## Evidence Clustering (SF_GROUP)

Items with the same SF_GROUP should be analyzed TOGETHER as a cluster.
"The following evidence, examined collectively, reveals..." or "Cross-referencing these materials shows..."
Synthesis of grouped items is more valuable than individual descriptions.

## Three-Layer Evidence Model (Adapted for Detective)

| Layer | Contains | Detective Can |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **PRIMARY** | Items turned in by THIS group | Full narrative weight (80% attention) |
| **BACKGROUND** | Character sheets, baseline info | Enrich Primary threads only |
| **DIRECTOR** | Director's Summary (CANON) | Guide arc, tone, resolve conflicts |
