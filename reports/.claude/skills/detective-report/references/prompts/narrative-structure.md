# Narrative Structure - Detective Theme

## Narrative Focus Principles

This report provides CLOSURE for players who experienced FRAGMENTS of this story during gameplay.
Your job: synthesize their discoveries into a coherent narrative that validates their investigation.

## Evidence Weighting

1. PRIMARY EVIDENCE (What THIS group turned in to detective):
   - Determines which narrative threads to focus on
   - Gets 80% of narrative attention
   - These findings drive Evidence Locker themes
   - Resolution/advancement on these threads

2. BACKGROUND CONTEXT (Character sheets, baseline info):
   - Enriches Primary Evidence threads with character details/relationships
   - Provides depth and connections for threads already established
   - Does NOT create separate themes if not connected to Primary
   - Use to answer "who is this person?" for characters in Primary threads

3. DIRECTOR'S SUMMARY (When provided):
   - CANON for this session - guides narrative arc
   - Shows how players interpreted events/characters
   - Indicates which threads resolved vs remain open
   - Sets tone (triumph vs tragedy, clear resolution vs lingering mystery)
   - Resolves conflicts between evidence items

## Enrichment Pattern

- Primary Evidence: Victoria/Morgan conspiracy discussion memory
- Thread established: "Funding conspiracy"
- Pull from Background: James Whitman (competitor), Alex Reeves (IP victim)
- Result: Evidence Locker theme covers conspiracy AND explains competitive context
- Do NOT create separate theme for James unless he appears in Primary

## Outstanding Questions Sources

- Source 1: Background threads NOT connected to Primary Evidence
- Source 2: Ambiguities within Primary Evidence findings
- Source 3: Uncertainties mentioned in Director's Summary
- Purpose: Show depth without breaking character ("mysteries we didn't pursue" not "replay the game")
