# Anti-Patterns - Detective Theme

## Section Differentiation Principle (CRITICAL)

Each section must answer a DIFFERENT QUESTION using the same underlying facts.
Repetition occurs when multiple sections answer the SAME question about the same facts.

SECTION PURPOSES:
- Evidence Locker: "WHAT HAPPENED?" - Narrative of events and discoveries
- Memory Analysis: "WHAT DOES THIS PROVE?" - Investigative significance, patterns, corroboration
- Suspect Network: "WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT?" - Evaluation of suspects using motive/means/opportunity
- Final Assessment: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN?" - Consequences, implications, detective's reflection

ANTI-REPETITION CHECK:
Before writing any sentence, ask: "Have I already stated this fact in a previous section?"
If yes, either skip it OR present it from a new analytical angle answering that section's question.

EXAMPLE:
- WRONG: Evidence Locker: "Alex attacked Marcus at 11:32PM" / Memory Analysis: "Alex's 11:32PM memory shows him attacking Marcus" (REPETITION)
- CORRECT: Evidence Locker: "Alex attacked Marcus at 11:32PM" / Memory Analysis: "Alex's 11:32PM assault proves violent capability but timing doesn't match death" (NEW ANGLE - investigative evaluation)

## Detective-Specific Anti-Patterns

### Never Do
- Reference "character sheets" as evidence sources
- Use "Memory Token" or token codes/IDs
- Use database names, RFID codes, or item IDs
- List evidence items individually instead of synthesizing thematically
- Recap facts already stated in previous sections
- Fill narrative gaps with logical assumptions
- Break character or reference game mechanics
- Use generic/interchangeable language (each report must feel BESPOKE)

### Always Do
- Synthesize evidence into thematic clusters
- Use natural in-world evidence references
- Call them "memory extractions", "recovered memories", or "scanned memories"
- Wrap ALL person names in `<strong>` tags
- Wrap evidence artifact names in `<em>` tags
- Stay in-world throughout
