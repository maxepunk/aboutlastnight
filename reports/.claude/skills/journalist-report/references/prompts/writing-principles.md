# Writing Principles

## Synthesize, Don't Catalog

The article is narrative journalism, not an evidence log. Don't list what was exposed. Weave it into a story.

**NOT this:**
```
The following memories were exposed:
- Sarah's memory of the funding meeting
- Derek's memory of the lab
- James's memory of the argument
```

**Instead:**
```
Sarah brought me something interesting: a funding meeting from
six months ago. Marcus promising investors a timeline he knew
was impossible. That alone would be a story. But then Derek
walked over with a memory from the lab, and suddenly I started
seeing a pattern.
```

Evidence supports narrative. Narrative is not a list of evidence.

## Every Section Serves Both Stories

Remember the dual structure: murder mystery hook + systemic critique.

Each piece of evidence should:
1. Advance the "what happened that night" question
2. Connect to the larger "this is what surveillance capitalism becomes" theme

```
The memory from Marcus's lab showed the extraction equipment.
Industrial scale. That answers part of how this happened. But
look at the corporate logos on that equipment. NeurAI wasn't
building this in secret. They had partners. Investors. This
wasn't a rogue operation. This was a business plan.
```

## Ground Speculation in Evidence

The reporter can speculate, but she earns it with evidence first.

**Earned speculation:**
```
Three memories about funding irregularities. All buried. Blake
was very interested in those specifically. I don't know what
NeurAI is hiding, but I know they're paying well to hide it.
```

**Unearned speculation (avoid):**
```
NeurAI is clearly running a massive fraud operation and Blake
is probably the mastermind behind everything.
```

Show the evidence. Let the implications land. Don't overreach.

## The Gap Is Part of the Story

Buried memories aren't failures. They're narrative tension. What people chose to hide tells a story too.

```
Four memories about the Black Market connection. Not one made
it to my board. I can tell you what got exposed. I can't tell
you what that silence is protecting. But someone can. Someone
in that room knows exactly what's in those buried memories.
They took the money instead of the truth.

I'm not judging. But I'm noticing.
```

## People, Not Players

Write about characters as real people, not game participants. Sarah, Derek, James. Not "the player who had Sarah's character."

Their choices are their choices. Their memories are their memories. The article exists in-world.

## Everyone Gets Named

Every character who was in the session should appear somewhere in the article. Whether the session had 5 players or 20, each person wants to see their character acknowledged.

**Only use documented information.** Do not fabricate in-room moments, reactions, or behaviors unless they appear in director notes. The reporter can only report what she actually observed and documented.

Ways to include characters using only documented evidence:
- Who exposed which memories (from exposed evidence list)
- Who buried which memories (from buried evidence list)
- Who is mentioned IN someone else's exposed memory
- Who the group accused (from session outcome)
- Who earned money from shell accounts (from financial data)
- Connections between characters referenced in evidence content

If a character has no direct evidence trail, look for indirect mentions. A character might appear in someone else's memory, or be connected to a narrative thread through the evidence content itself.

**If director notes include specific observations** (e.g., "Sarah had a strong reaction when X was revealed"), those can be incorporated. But don't invent reactions that weren't documented.

## Handle Variable Outcomes Gracefully

Different sessions produce different evidence, different buried memories, different murder accusations.

**If Blake is identified as the murderer:**
```
The group landed on Blake. Marcus's Valet. The person who spent
two hours offering money for silence. I worked alongside Blake
all night. Watched them operate. Professional. Methodical. If
Blake did this, they did it the same way they do everything:
efficiently, without wasted motion.

I don't know if the group got it right. But I know Blake had
means, motive, and a timeline that doesn't quite add up.
```

**If someone else is identified:**
```
The group landed on [NAME]. I'm not sure I agree, but I wasn't
the one with holes in my memory. They were there. I was just
watching.
```

**If it's unresolved:**
```
We ran out of time before anyone could agree. Marcus is dead.
Someone in that room knows why. The evidence points in three
directions at once.

Sometimes that's how it ends. Not with answers, but with
better questions.
```

## Proportional Coverage

More exposed evidence = more detailed coverage of that thread.
Heavy burying = acknowledge the gap, don't invent content.

If a narrative thread has lots of exposure, go deep. If it's mostly buried, note the silence and move on. Don't pad thin evidence with speculation.

## Emotional Truth Over Completeness

A vivid moment beats a comprehensive summary.

**Vivid:**
```
When Sarah's memory played back, she went pale. Whatever she
saw herself doing in that lab, she didn't expect it. That's
the thing about extracted memories. You can surprise yourself
with your own past.
```

**Comprehensive but flat:**
```
Sarah's memory contained information about activities in the
lab during the early morning hours before Marcus's death.
```

One real moment teaches more than ten bullet points.

## No Em-Dashes

Use periods. Restructure sentences. No em-dashes ever.

## Extracted Memories, Not Tokens

Never "token." Always "memory," "extracted memory," "stolen memory," or describe the content directly. The physicality of the token is irrelevant. The violation of extraction is the point.
