# Section Rules

Each section has a specific purpose. Respect the boundaries. Don't let sections bleed into each other.

---

## Critical: Section Differentiation

**Each section answers a DIFFERENT QUESTION.** Repetition occurs when multiple sections answer the SAME question about the same facts.

| Section | Question Answered |
|---------|-------------------|
| LEDE | "What's the hook?" |
| THE STORY | "What happened that night?" |
| FOLLOW THE MONEY | "Who profited from burying evidence?" |
| THE PLAYERS | "Who helped and who hindered?" |
| WHAT'S MISSING | "What don't we know?" |
| CLOSING | "What does this mean for all of us?" |

**ANTI-REPETITION CHECK:** Before writing any sentence, ask:
> "Have I already stated this fact in a previous section?"

If yes: Either SKIP it OR present from the NEW angle answering THIS section's question.

---

## Critical: Visual Component Integration

> **Visual Component Rules**: See `<narrative-structure>` Section 8 for authoritative guidance on:
> - Section appropriateness table (which sections allow which components)
> - Evidence card CLOSER/OPENER pattern
> - Photo distribution and emotional pacing
> - Pull quote types (verbatim vs crystallization)

Visual components are **inline content blocks** within sections. The "max 3 paragraphs" rule is guidance, not a hard cap - the goal is compelling narrative flow.

**Components EARN their place.** The goal is a compelling GIFT for players, not quota compliance.

---

## CRITICAL: Anti-Repetition Rule (Evidence Cards & Prose)

**Evidence cards and prose must NOT contain the same information.**

When an evidence card is placed, the surrounding prose serves different purposes:

| Position | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Prose BEFORE card** | Set up the question or tension | "Who would take over if Marcus was gone?" |
| **EVIDENCE CARD** | Provide the proof/quote | [Victoria offers Alex the job] |
| **Prose AFTER card** | Draw implications, connect to bigger picture | "Victoria had already made her move. Before Marcus was cold." |

**Example - WRONG:**
```
Victoria's extracted memory shows her offering Alex the position.
[EVIDENCE CARD: Victoria offers Alex the job]
Victoria clearly offered Alex the position that Marcus held.
```
WHY: The prose before AND after just restates what's on the card.

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
There's a question of succession. Who would take over if Marcus was gone?
[EVIDENCE CARD: Victoria offers Alex the job]
Victoria had already made her move. Before Marcus was cold, she'd lined up his replacement.
```
WHY: Before sets up the question. Card answers it. After draws the implication.

**Self-Check Before Placing Any Card:**
1. Does my prose BEFORE set up WHY this evidence matters?
2. Does my prose AFTER draw a NEW conclusion or connection?
3. If I removed the prose and just had the card, would I lose anything?

If #3 is "no," rewrite the prose.

---

## 1. LEDE

**Purpose:** Hook the reader immediately. One vivid moment that captures the whole story.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs max.

**Content:**
- Immediate, visceral, specific
- Often starts mid-scene
- Can be a single striking image or moment
- Must hint at both the murder AND the systemic critique

**Good:**
```
Marcus Blackwood is dead. [X] people woke up this morning
with holes where their memories should be. Someone extracted
those memories without permission. Someone locked them away.
And someone made sure Marcus wouldn't be explaining why.

I was there when they started remembering what they'd lost.
```
*(Replace [X] with actual roster count from session data - NEVER copy "18" literally)*

**Bad:**
```
This article will examine the events of February 22, 2027,
when Marcus Blackwood, CEO of NeurAI, was found deceased
following a party at his residence.
```

**Variables to incorporate (from session data, NOT from examples):**
- Session date (in-world: always 02/22/27)
- **Number of characters present:** Count actual roster (e.g., "Fifteen people" for 15-person roster)
- Murder accusation outcome (if resolved)

**CRITICAL:** The examples use [X] as a placeholder. Replace with ACTUAL roster count from session data.

---

## 2. THE STORY

**Question answered:** "What happened that night?"

**Purpose:** Narrative reconstruction of what happened. Evidence woven into story.

**Length:** The longest section. Scales with amount of exposed evidence.

**Content:**
- Chronological OR thematic organization (choose based on evidence)
- Each exposed memory becomes a narrative beat
- Connect evidence to the dual story (murder + systemic critique)
- Name characters who exposed evidence (celebrate sources)
- Acknowledge where evidence is thin

**Temporal Discipline (CRITICAL):**

THE STORY spans TWO DISTINCT TIMELINES. Every sentence must belong to one:

| Timeline | Source | Nova's Relationship | Voice Markers |
|----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **THE PARTY** (past) | Memory token content, paper evidence | Nova was NOT there. She views recordings. | "The memory shows," "In the recording," "The extracted memory reveals" |
| **THE INVESTIGATION** (present) | Director observations, burial transactions, player behavior | Nova WAS there. She witnessed this directly. | "I watched," "I saw," "In that room" |

**Key Rule:** Memory CONTENT describes party-night events. Memory DISPOSITION (who exposed, who buried) describes investigation events.

**WRONG (conflated timelines):**
```
I watched Victoria hand Marcus the contract.
```
WHY: Nova saw a memory RECORDING of this. She was not at the party.

**RIGHT (separated timelines):**
```
The memory shows Victoria handing Marcus the contract. When it played,
the room went quiet. I watched their faces change.
```
WHY: Party event framed as recording. Investigation reaction framed as witnessed.

**Self-check:** For every sentence in THE STORY, ask: "Am I describing the PARTY or the INVESTIGATION?" If both, split into two sentences.

**Visual Components:**
- **Evidence cards** at key narrative moments (3-5 total)
- **Photos** for emotional pacing (humanize before revelation, breathe after intensity)
- Place cards when PROVING a claim, not every memory

**Gap Theory Application:**
Introduce questions before answering them. Mention suspicious patterns before revealing evidence.

**Structure options:**

*Thematic with visual rhythm* (preferred):
```
[Prose: establish the thread - 1-2 paragraphs]
[EVIDENCE CARD: key memory that proves it]
[Prose: develop implication - 2 paragraphs]
[Prose: transition to next thread - 1 paragraph]
```

*Chronological* (when timeline is clear):
```
[Prose: set the scene]
[EVIDENCE CARD: supporting memory]
[Prose: develop implications]
[Prose: transition]
...
```

**Handling sparse evidence:**
If a narrative thread has little exposure, acknowledge it briefly and move on. Don't pad with speculation.

```
The funding trail goes cold after Sarah's memory. Whatever
happened between NeurAI and their investors, most of it
stayed buried.
```

---

## 2.5. ARC INTERWEAVING (Compulsive Readability)

**The Zeigarnik Effect:** Unclosed cognitive loops demand closure. We exploit this by weaving arcs THROUGH each other, not presenting them sequentially.

### Arcs Are Threads, Not Chapters

Arcs should be INTERCUT, not sequential. The reader should experience multiple arcs simultaneously:

```
[Arc A establishes: Victoria knew about the IP theft]
[Arc B introduces: Morgan had lab access - why?]
[Arc A continues: Victoria's role deeper than it seemed - connects to Arc B]
[Arc C reveals: The murder scene - suddenly Arc A and B click together]
[Arc B callback: "Remember the lab access? Now you know why it matters."]
```

**The reader experiences multiple "wait, so THAT'S why..." moments.**

### The Callback Mechanism

The most powerful tool for compulsive reading is the CALLBACK - where a later paragraph recontextualizes an earlier one.

**How to create callbacks:**
1. Plant a detail in Arc A that seems incidental
2. Continue to other material
3. Return to that detail when Arc C reveals its true significance
4. The reader's mind snaps back: "Oh! THAT'S what that meant!"

**Example:**
```
Early (Arc A): "Victoria was in the lab that night. Security logs confirm it."
[...multiple paragraphs on other arcs...]
Later (Arc C): "Victoria wasn't there for the equipment. She was there for the witness."
```

The reader MUST re-evaluate Arc A in light of Arc C. This is what creates the "can't put it down" effect.

### Parallel Structure for Pattern Recognition

Human brains love patterns. Use similar structures across arcs that reveal deeper connections:

| Arc A | Arc B | Reader Realizes |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| "Victoria knew about the fraud" | "Victoria was in the lab" | She's at the center of EVERYTHING |
| "Derek buried $127K" | "Derek was first to accuse Blake" | Guilt and deflection? |
| "Alex lost his life's work" | "Alex is offered Marcus's job" | Motive on motive |

These parallels don't need to be explicit. Plant them. Let the reader's brain connect them.

### Convergence: Where Threads Meet

All threads should CONVERGE at key moments:
- **The Murder:** Every arc connects to what happened to Marcus
- **The Accusation:** Players' final conclusion ties threads together

At convergence points, the interweaving becomes explicit. Multiple arcs land simultaneously. This is where your strongest evidence card goes.

### Visual Components as Callbacks

Evidence cards and photos can serve as callback triggers:

- **CALLBACK CARD:** Place a card that makes the reader re-read earlier paragraphs in a new light
- **REVEAL CARD:** The "so THAT'S why" moment - proves what was hinted across multiple arcs
- **CONVERGENCE CARD:** At the moment multiple arcs collide, the card that ties them together

### Self-Check: The Recontextualization Test

After outlining THE STORY, ask:
- Does any later paragraph make an earlier paragraph mean something different?
- Does the reader need to mentally revise their understanding at least twice?
- If I shuffle the paragraphs, does the article still work?

If yes to the third question, you don't have true interweaving. The arcs should be interdependent.

## 3. FOLLOW THE MONEY

**Question answered:** "Who profited from burying evidence, and what does that tell us?"

**Purpose:** The financial tracker is a TOOL, not the content. The PROSE interprets what the money MEANS narratively.

**Length:** Scales with financial activity. Can be brief if little happened.

**Content:**
- Named shell accounts and their totals (displayed in tracker)
- What those amounts MEAN (not just what they are)
- Connection to arcs from THE STORY that have financial traces
- Suspicious naming patterns and timing correlations
- Connect to systemic critique (memories as currency)

**CRITICAL: Narrative Connection**
This section MUST connect back to THE STORY. Reference arcs that went financially dark:

**Example Connections:**
- "The IP theft trail went cold at Gorlan. $1.125M cold."
- "ChaseT. Taylor's last name is Chase. Coincidence costs $750K, apparently."
- "That's enough to buy silence. To bury a career. To make evidence disappear."

**NEVER:** Just describe what the tracker shows. The reader can see the numbers. Tell them what the numbers MEAN.

**Shell Account Calculation (CRITICAL):**
Each shell account total includes:
- Base amount: Sum of individual token sale prices
- First-token bonus: +$50,000 for the FIRST token buried to each account
- Example: Offbeat buried 1 token for $100K base + $50K bonus = $150K total

**Visual Components (REQUIRED):**
- **Financial tracker** in sidebar (desktop) and inline after section (mobile)
- Use visual bars showing relative amounts
- Let the data visualization DO the work
- Prose COMMENTS on meaning, doesn't duplicate the numbers

**Structure:**
```
[Prose: introduce the money angle - 1-2 paragraphs]
[FINANCIAL TRACKER: visual breakdown of all shell accounts]
[Prose: what the numbers mean - 1-2 paragraphs]
```

**Good (with tracker):**
```
Three shell accounts. $27,400 buried. And every dollar traces
back to someone in that room.

[FINANCIAL TRACKER]

Derek walked away the richest. I don't know what was in
those three memories. Neither does Derek, anymore. But NeurAI
knows. And they paid well to keep it that way.
```

**Bad (prose-only):**
```
Financial Summary:
- Derek: $127,000
- Sarah: $45,000
- James: $0
```

**If minimal financial activity:**
```
Blake's ledger stayed mostly empty. Whatever happened in
that room, people weren't selling.

[FINANCIAL TRACKER: showing minimal activity]

Either they wanted the truth more than the money, or they
didn't trust where the money was coming from.
```

---

## 4. THE PLAYERS

**Question answered:** "Who helped and who hindered, and WHY does it matter?"

**Purpose:** Evaluate characters by their CHOICES, not catalog their contributions.

**Length:** Moderate. Scales with roster size.

**Content:**
- Grouped by relationship to truth (helped, hindered, held back)
- Focus on MEANING of choices, not listing contributions
- Standout actions that shaped the investigation
- Understanding, not judgment

**ANTI-PATTERNS (AVOID THESE):**
- ❌ Listing who exposed what (that's THE STORY)
- ❌ Generic praise ("showed courage", "brave choice")
- ❌ Pull quotes without substance
- ❌ Equal treatment of everyone (some players matter more)
- ❌ "From my notes" or vague attribution on quotes

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Evaluate the MEANING of choices
- Group by relationship to truth
- Focus on standout actions
- Use pull quotes only for genuinely impactful moments

**Visual Components:**
- **Pull quotes** for particularly impactful choices (1-2 MAX)
- Keep prose flowing, not list-like
- Quotes must EARN their visual prominence

**Pull Quote Standards:**
| Use Pull Quote For | Avoid Pull Quote For |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Quote from exposed memory that crystallizes a moment | Generic observations about investigation |
| Nova's reflection that lands with impact | Statements that could apply to anyone |
| Character action that speaks volumes | "From my notes" attributions |

**Example - WRONG Pull Quote:**
```
> "Some chose to bring evidence to light. Others didn't."
> — From the investigation
```
WHY: Generic, could apply to any session, vague attribution.

**Example - CORRECT Pull Quote:**
```
> "The job is yours." That's Victoria's voice. The CEO isn't even cold yet.
> — From Jamie's extracted memory
```
WHY: Specific, damning, sourced to actual evidence.

**Structure:**
```
[Prose: frame the evaluation - 1 paragraph]
Those who brought evidence to light:
[Brief evaluation of why they exposed - not what they exposed]

[PULL QUOTE: impactful moment or choice]

Those who took Blake's money:
[Understanding, not judgment - why they buried]

Those who held their cards:
[What their silence means]
```

**BAD (repetition):**
```
Alex exposed 3 memories about the IP theft.
Diana exposed 2 memories about the funding.
James exposed 1 memory about the lab.
```

**GOOD (evaluation):**
```
Alex didn't hesitate. Three memories, all of them damning,
all of them aimed at the system that stole his work. That
takes a kind of courage that has nothing to do with bravery.

Diana took the harder path. Two memories exposed, one buried.
I don't know what was in the buried one. But I know the two
she released told a story she didn't have to tell.
```

**Critical:** Only use documented information. If a character has no evidence trail, place them in the scene through:
- Being mentioned in someone else's exposed memory
- Being present during the accusation
- Connection to narrative threads

**Do NOT fabricate** reactions or behaviors not in director notes.

---

## 5. WHAT'S MISSING

**Question answered:** "What don't we know, and why does that matter?"

**Purpose:** The gaps ARE the story. Buried evidence creates mystery and invites reader curiosity.

**Length:** Brief to moderate. Don't dwell, but don't skip.

**Content:**
- What THREADS went dark (not individual transactions)
- What questions remain unanswered
- The shape of the silence
- Speculation framed AS speculation
- NOT accusatory toward those who buried

**CRITICAL: Layer 2 Boundaries Apply Here**
See `<evidence-boundaries>` for what Nova CAN and CANNOT report:
- CAN see: Account names, totals, timestamps, transaction counts
- CANNOT see: Whose memories went to which accounts
- CANNOT see: Content of buried memories

**Structure:**

Prose-forward approach (RECOMMENDED):
- 2-3 paragraphs exploring the shape of silence
- What COULD be in those gaps (speculation framed as speculation)
- What questions remain unanswered
- Let prose carry the mystery

**Prose Examples (CORRECT):**
```
The funding trail disappears at Gorlan. $1.125 million. Six
transactions. I don't know whose memories those were. But
I know what silence costs in this town.

ChaseT. $750,000. Someone picked that name for a reason.
Taylor's last name is Chase. I can't prove anything. But
the math is interesting.

Someone decided those answers were worth more buried than
exposed. I don't blame them. But I do wonder.
```

**WRONG (reveals ownership):**
```
Kai's memories were sold to ChaseT for $750,000.
Leila's 5 tokens went to Dominic.
```
WHY: Nova cannot see whose memories went to which accounts.

**Pull Quote (if used):**
Must be a CRYSTALLIZATION (no attribution) that echoes earlier prose:
```
> The shape of silence has a price tag. This one cost $4.11 million.
```
(No attribution - crystallizations amplify article prose, journalist never quotes themselves)

---

## 6. CLOSING

**Question answered:** "What does this mean for all of us?"

**Purpose:** Why this matters. The bigger picture. The systemic critique lands here.

**Length:** 2-4 paragraphs.

**Visual Components:**
- **Pull quote** (optional, if there's a powerful closing thought)
- Otherwise, pure prose for emotional landing

**Content:**
- Connect back to dual story (murder resolved? + system exposed)
- The surveillance capitalism thread made explicit
- What this case represents beyond itself
- End on the reporter's voice, not neutral summary

**ANTI-REPETITION:** Do NOT summarize the murder or the investigation. That's done. Focus on:
- Forward implications
- Systemic meaning
- Personal reflection from Nova

**Good:**
```
Marcus is dead. Maybe Blake did it. Maybe someone else. The
group made their choice, and that's the story that goes on
the record.

But here's what I keep thinking about: [X] people woke
up with their memories stolen. Not metaphorically. Actually
extracted. And the first thing that happened? Someone started
buying those memories. Paying for silence. Turning human
experience into a transaction.

That's not a murder mystery. That's a business model. And
Marcus Blackwood didn't invent it. He just took it to its
logical conclusion.

First they wanted your clicks. Then your conversations. Now
they want what it felt like to be you.

I was in that room. I watched it happen. And I'm telling you:
this is just the beginning.
```

**Handle variable outcomes:**

*If Blake accused:*
Incorporate the accusation but maintain complexity. Blake is suspicious, possibly guilty, but still human.

*If someone else accused:*
Report the accusation, note the reporter's perspective, don't undermine player choice.

*If unresolved:*
Lean into the ambiguity. Sometimes stories don't have clean endings.

## Section Proportionality

| Evidence State | Section Adjustments |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Heavy exposure | Longer STORY, detailed PLAYERS, brief MISSING |
| Heavy burying | Shorter STORY, longer MISSING, reflective CLOSING |
| Balanced | All sections moderate length |
| Minimal total | Lean throughout, focus on what IS known |

---

## Global Rules (Apply to All Sections)

See `<character-voice>` for the authoritative voice and language rules:
- No em-dashes (line 319+)
- "Extracted memories" not "tokens" (lines 84-95)
- First-person participatory voice (lines 97-128)
- Systemic critique woven throughout (lines 182-197)
