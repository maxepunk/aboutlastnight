# Arc Flow & Interweaving

How narrative arcs thread through the entire article. Arcs are NOT sequential chapters. They are INTERLEAVED threads that weave through every section.

## Core Philosophy

**Arcs are THREADS, not CHAPTERS.**

- Arc A paragraph → Arc B paragraph → Arc A continues → Arc C reveals
- Later paragraphs should RECONTEXTUALIZE earlier ones ("wait, so THAT'S why...")
- Plant details in Arc A that pay off in Arc C
- If you can shuffle arc paragraphs without breaking the narrative, you've failed

**Test:** If the reader can identify where one arc ends and another begins, you've failed. Arc boundaries should feel like a conversation topic shifting, not a chapter break.

## Arc-Section Mapping

Each arc should appear in multiple sections with different focus:

| Section | Arc Role |
|---------|----------|
| LEDE | Primary arc establishes the hook and central tension |
| THE STORY | All arcs interleaved, with convergence point |
| FOLLOW THE MONEY | Financial threads from each arc continue here |
| THE PLAYERS | Character angles advancing each arc |
| WHAT'S MISSING | Gaps/questions raised by each arc create tension |
| CLOSING | Arc resolutions or haunting continuations |

**Every section (except LEDE) must have "arcConnections"** showing which arcs it advances.

## Interweaving Techniques

### Callback Seeds
Plant specific details in one arc that pay off in another:

```
Arc A: "Morgan mentioned a second lab, somewhere in Oakland."
[continue with other content]
Arc C: "The Oakland address on the shipping manifest. Morgan's 'second lab.'"
```

### Shared Characters
Use characters appearing in multiple arcs as bridges:

```
[Victoria appears in Arc A about funding]
[prose continues other arc]
[Victoria reappears in Arc C about the cover-up, connecting the threads]
```

### Convergence Point
Identify where all arcs meet (usually mid-THE STORY):

```
THE STORY arc plan:
- Paragraphs 1-3: Arc A setup
- Paragraphs 4-6: Arc B intercuts
- Paragraphs 7-8: Arc C enters
- Paragraph 9: CONVERGENCE - all three arcs collide
- Paragraphs 10-12: Resolution cascade
```

## THE STORY Section: Interleaving Plan

THE STORY is where arcs must interweave most tightly. Plan it as:

1. **Interleaving plan**: How arcs will be intercut (not sequential)
2. **Callback opportunities**: Details planted in one arc that pay off in another
3. **Convergence point**: Where all arcs meet (paragraph/section location)

**Example structure for 3 arcs:**
```
Para 1: Arc A setup (plant detail X)
Para 2: Arc B enters (introduces Morgan)
Para 3: Arc A continues (escalates tension)
Para 4: Arc C enters (the money angle)
Para 5: Arc B returns (Morgan connects to money)
Para 6: CONVERGENCE (all three arcs collide)
Para 7: Arc A resolution (detail X pays off)
Para 8: Final implications (reader recontextualizes earlier paragraphs)
```

## Interweaving Self-Check

Before finalizing outline or article:

- [ ] Are arcs INTERCUT (not sequential chapters)?
- [ ] Does any later paragraph recontextualize an earlier one?
- [ ] If I shuffle paragraphs, would it break? (Should be YES)
- [ ] Are there at least 2 "wait, so THAT'S why..." moments?
- [ ] Do shared characters serve as bridges between arcs?
- [ ] Is there a clear convergence point in THE STORY?
- [ ] Does every section (except LEDE) advance at least one arc?

## Common Failures

### Sequential Chapter Structure (BAD)
```
THE STORY:
- "First, the funding scandal..." (Arc A complete)
- "Next, the cover-up..." (Arc B complete)
- "Finally, the money trail..." (Arc C complete)
```

This is a character catalog disguised as arcs. Arcs should INTERWEAVE.

### No Recontextualization (BAD)
Every paragraph only makes sense in isolation. Later reveals don't change how earlier paragraphs read.

### Missing Callbacks (BAD)
Details are planted but never pay off. Or payoffs appear without setup.

### No Convergence (BAD)
Arcs exist in parallel but never collide. The reader doesn't see how they connect.

## Integration with Other Sections

**FOLLOW THE MONEY:**
- Continue arc threads through financial lens per arcConnections
- Each arc's money angle gets its moment
- Shell accounts connect to specific arcs

**THE PLAYERS:**
- Advance arcs through character revelations per arcConnections
- Characters are evaluated through the lens of arc involvement

**WHAT'S MISSING:**
- Honor the knownUnknowns - gaps Nova noticed per arc
- Each arc has unanswered questions creating tension

**CLOSING:**
- Resolve or haunt per arcResolutions
- Each arc gets its ending or its lingering question
