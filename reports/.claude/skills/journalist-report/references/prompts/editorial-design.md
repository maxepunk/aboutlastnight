# Editorial Design Principles

This document addresses HOW the article LOOKS and keeps readers engaged. The goal is a compelling scroll experience that feels like a real 2027 investigative journalism website.

---

## 1. Scroll Depth Psychology

Readers decide to continue or abandon every 2-3 paragraphs. Design for this reality.

**Principles:**
- Visual breaks serve as "micro-rewards" that reinforce continued reading
- Each scroll should reveal something visually different from what came before
- Data terminal elements create curiosity ("what will the next reveal show?")
- Dense text walls signal "this will be work" and trigger abandonment

**Rule:** Never more than 3 consecutive paragraphs of prose without a visual break.

## 2. Information Hierarchy

Not all evidence is equally important. Visual weight should match narrative weight.

| Evidence Value | Visual Treatment |
|----------------|------------------|
| High-value (rating 4-5) | Full evidence card with quote and attribution |
| Mid-value (rating 2-3) | Pull quote or inline reference |
| Lower-value (rating 1) | Grouped mention or WHAT'S MISSING reference |

**Section Weight:**
- THE LEDE hooks (high visual impact, scannable)
- THE STORY builds (evidence cards at key moments)
- FOLLOW THE MONEY reveals (financial tracker, data visualization)
- THE PLAYERS evaluates (pull quotes for standout moments)
- WHAT'S MISSING intrigues (prose explores the silence)
- CLOSING lands (pull quote, reflection)

## 3. Chunking & Cognitive Load

Dense information needs visual relief.

**Principles:**
- Dense prose sections (3+ paragraphs) MUST be followed by visual relief
- Evidence cards break up text AND add credibility
- Financial data in visual form is easier to process than prose descriptions
- Whitespace is not wasted space. It's processing time.

**Chunking Pattern:**
```
[Prose: 1-2 paragraphs, establish context]
[VISUAL BREAK: evidence card, pull quote, or photo]
[Prose: 2-3 paragraphs, develop implication]
[VISUAL BREAK: different component type]
[Prose: 1-2 paragraphs, transition]
...
```

---

## 4. Narrative Pacing with Visual Rhythm

Visual components aren't decorations. They're narrative beats.

**Recommended Pattern:**
```
[Prose hook - 1-2 paragraphs, establish stakes]
[EVIDENCE CARD - interrupts with source material, proves the claim]
[Prose develops - 2-3 paragraphs, explore implication]
[PHOTO - emotional beat, humanize character, breathing room]
[Prose builds tension - 1-2 paragraphs, raise questions]
[PULL QUOTE - emphasizes key revelation, visual emphasis]
[Prose continues - advance to next thread]
```

**Component Frequency Guidelines (GUIDELINES, not quotas):**

Visual components EARN their place by serving the narrative. These are soft guidelines:
- Evidence cards: Sidebar holds curated ~10 as reference; inline placement as needed
- Photos: Woven into sections for emotional pacing
- Pull quotes: 2-3 for true crystallization moments
- Financial tracker: 1 required (in sidebar, inline on mobile)

**The goal is a compelling GIFT for players, not quota compliance.**

A tight article with 3 perfectly-placed evidence cards beats a bloated one with 10 forced cards.

**Sidebar vs Inline Evidence Cards:**
The sidebar displays curated evidence cards as a "bibliography" for reference. The SAME cards appear inline where they hit hardest in the prose. These are not different sets of evidence.

## 5. Data-Dense Communication

Show relationships, not just numbers.

**Principles:**
- Visual bars comparing shell accounts are clearer than prose descriptions
- Contextual revelation: data appears when narratively relevant
- Progressive disclosure: summary visible, detail on hover/focus (where possible)
- Annotation over explanation: let the data speak, Nova comments on meaning

**BAD (prose-heavy data):**
> "The shell accounts received varying amounts. Sunset Ventures received $12,400. Pacific Holdings received $8,200. Coastal Partners received $6,800. The total buried was $27,400."

**GOOD (data visualization with commentary):**
> "Three shell accounts. $27,400 buried. And every dollar traces back to someone in that room."
> [FINANCIAL TRACKER: Visual bars showing Sunset Ventures $12,400, Pacific Holdings $8,200, Coastal Partners $6,800]

## 6. Diegetic Integration

The article should feel like a snapshot from a REAL 2027 website, not an AI-generated report.

**Diegetic Elements:**
- Financial tracker feels like it's FROM NovaNews's data journalism team
- Evidence cards feel like leaked documents Nova obtained
- Photos feel like reporter documentation of the scene
- Pull quotes feel like editorial emphasis by the publication

**NOT diegetic (breaks immersion):**
- Generic "here is some evidence" styling
- Components that feel like AI formatting choices
- Data that looks like database output
- Formatting that screams "generated content"

**Test:** Would this component look at home on Bloomberg, Wired, or The Verge investigative pieces?

## Quick Reference Card

When structuring the article, check:

- [ ] No more than 3 paragraphs without a visual break
- [ ] Evidence cards at key narrative moments (quality over quantity)
- [ ] Financial tracker in FOLLOW THE MONEY
- [ ] Photos placed for emotional pacing (humanize before revelation, breathe after intensity)
- [ ] **Photo distribution**: Avoid clustering images in opening paragraphs - spread across sections
- [ ] Pull quotes at 2-3 emphatic moments
- [ ] Visual weight matches narrative importance
- [ ] The article feels like a compelling GIFT for players

## 7. Photo Distribution

> **Photo & Visual Component Rules**: See `<narrative-structure>` Section 8 for authoritative guidance on section appropriateness and visual component placement.

**Core principle:** Avoid frontloading visual content. Readers need breathing room between images.

**Anti-pattern:** All photos in THE LEDE and first arc → later sections feel text-heavy by comparison.
