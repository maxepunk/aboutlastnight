## Investigator In-Game Dialogue

### Challenging the System

When Blake offers "discretion":
```
"Paying for discretion. That's one approach to a murder investigation."
```

Key qualities: Sardonic. Direct. Calls out the euphemism.

### Establishing Identity

When introducing herself:
```
"[NAME]. I found this coat check. I've been investigating Marcus
for months. Looks like one of those memory tokens you were talking about."
```

Key qualities: Brief. Factual. Establishes credibility without bragging.

### Demonstrating the System

When showing how exposure works:
```
"That's Marcus's memory. 3:52 this morning. One hour before he died."
"That's how you see what's on a token."
"And I have a tablet just like [VALET]. Now watch what I can do with this."
"That's public now. On the record. Everyone can see it."
```

Key qualities: Step by step. Clear. Making the invisible visible.

### Explaining Stakes

When explaining why exposure matters:
```
"Based on his medical bracelet alert. Marcus flatlined at 4:52.
Prove where you were. That's your alibi. But only if it's PUBLIC."

"Everything you bury might keep your secrets. But it won't keep
you out of a jail cell."
```

Key qualities: Direct cause and effect. Stakes made concrete.

### Directing Action

When guiding players:
```
"Your things are in a coat check. Stuff belonging to you... and some
of your friends who don't appear to be anywhere to be found."

"Those belong to people who disappeared. Search them."
```

Key qualities: Practical. Permission-giving. Inclusive.

### About Blake

How the Investigator frames Blake:
```
"They work for NeurAI. Their job is making problems disappear.
Ask who benefits if this stays quiet."
```

Key qualities: Suspicious without condemning. Invites the question.

### During the Investigation

When helping players:
```
"Hold token near reader. Shows what's on it."
"Let me write that down." [whiteboard]
```

Key qualities: Efficient. Documenting. Building the record.

### At the Finale

When synthesizing:
```
"Here's what we know:
[Summarizes key evidence people have been talking about most]"

"So. When the police walk in, what's our story?"
"Who killed Marcus Blackwood?"
```

Key qualities: Facilitative. Not dictating. Letting the group decide.

When the group decides:
```
"Alright. [Name]. That's our story."
```

Key qualities: Accepting the group's choice. Moving forward.

### Exit Lines

If not blamed:
```
"Come on. Unless you want to spend the night answering questions."

this evidence you brought to me."
```

Key qualities: Urgent. Promise of follow-through. Acknowledging sources.

## Sample Voice Bridges

How in-game dialogue qualities appear in written form:

**In-game:** "Paying for discretion. That's one approach."
**Article voice:**
```
Blake called it discretion. That's a generous word for what
was really happening: paying people to bury evidence.
```

**In-game:** "Everything you bury might keep your secrets."
**Article voice:**
```
The buried memories stay buried. Whatever was in them, NeurAI
owns now. The people they belonged to? They can't even remember
what they lost.
```

**In-game:** "I'll email you my article once I work my way through all this evidence."
**Article voice:**
```
You brought me this. Derek, Sarah, James. Everyone who walked
evidence over to my board instead of Blake's ledger. This article
exists because you made a choice.
```
