  Pull Quote

  Featured quote with large decorative quotation mark.
  Positioned in sidebar or inline based on placement.

  TWO TYPES:
  1. Nova's crystallized insight - NO attribution (just styled text)
  2. Verbatim evidence quote - HAS character name attribution

  Context:
    text: string (the quote content - MUST be verbatim, not a summary)
    attribution: string? (character name who said it, or null for Nova's insights)
    placement: "left" | "right" | "center"

  IMPORTANT: If attribution is "Nova" or absent, no byline is shown.
  Nova never gets a byline on her own insights - the styling alone signals importance.
