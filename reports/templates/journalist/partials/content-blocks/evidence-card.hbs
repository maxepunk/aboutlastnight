  Inline Evidence Card

  Full evidence display placed within article flow.
  Shows complete quotable content from memory tokens or paper evidence.

  Context:
    tokenId: string (unique evidence identifier)
    headline: string (compelling headline for the card)
    content: string (full quotable evidence text - from fullDescription)
    owner: string? (character who owns this evidence, e.g., "Rachel Torres")
    significance: "critical" | "supporting" | "contextual"

  NARRATIVE PURPOSE:
  Evidence cards are the "receipts" that prove Nova's claims.
  Use them to:
  - Anchor accusations with primary source material
  - Let damning content speak for itself
  - Create emotional gut-punches at arc climaxes

  NOTE: Nova NEVER reveals sources. No submitter field is used.
