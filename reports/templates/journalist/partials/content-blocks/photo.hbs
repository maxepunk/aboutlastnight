  Inline Article Photo

  Session photos placed within article flow.
  Photos serve as emotional beats and arc bridges.

  Context:
    filename: string (photo filename in photos/ directory)
    src: string (full path to photo, transformed by template-assembler)
    caption: string (figcaption text)
    characters: string[]? (character names visible in photo)
    placement: "inline" | "sidebar" (determines styling)

  NARRATIVE PURPOSE:
  Photos reset emotional temperature. Use them to:
  - Let reader breathe before escalation
  - Humanize a character before damning revelation
  - Bridge between arcs with same character in different context
