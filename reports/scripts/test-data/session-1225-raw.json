    "accusation": "The group largely blamed Victoria and Morgan for collusion to murder Marcus. The final vote was nearly unanimous, with 12 out of 15 players voting for this conclusion. Some players noted that Derek seemed suspiciously defensive throughout the investigation, but the evidence pointing to Victoria-Morgan collaboration was overwhelming.",

    "directorNotes": "DIRECTOR OBSERVATIONS:\n\n1. Taylor and Diana initially interacted with the Valet together, then were seen dealing with the Valet separately later - suggests possible falling out\n\n2. Offbeat shell account was activated early with a 50,000 first buried token bonus but showed no subsequent transactions until 9:28 PM - suspicious timing\n\n3. ChaseT shell account displayed significant activity during the second half of the investigation, receiving tokens from Derek, Victoria, and Diana - possible coordinated dumping\n\n4. Kai conducted last-minute transactions with the Valet while others monitored shell account activity - trying to avoid detection?\n\n5. James never spoke to Blake once throughout the evening despite Blake's efforts to establish rapport - intentional avoidance or prior arrangement?\n\n6. Victoria and Morgan appeared to work together throughout the investigation, often huddled in corner conversations\n\n7. John D. (Oliver's in-game persona) successfully remained anonymous throughout while accumulating substantial profit through CryptoQueen\n\nSUSPICIOUS CORRELATIONS:\n- Taylor and Diana's relationship deterioration suggests possible falling out over valet dealings\n- Victoria and Morgan's collaboration may extend to Black market dealings through Blake\n- ChaseT account may be connected to an individual using the moniker 'Dominic' (Derek?)",
