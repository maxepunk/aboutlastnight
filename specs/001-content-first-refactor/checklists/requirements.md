# Specification Quality Checklist: Content-First Codebase Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Detailed Review**:

### Content Quality
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT (content editor can search/update text) without specifying HOW (no mention of specific file formats, templating engines, or code patterns)
- ✅ **User value focused**: Clear business rationale - "Content updates are the most frequent operation (weekly during campaign). Blocking on technical availability slows marketing response time and costs money."
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: User stories describe scenarios without technical jargon, understandable by content editors and stakeholders
- ✅ **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements (Functional + Entities), and Success Criteria all present and filled

### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete. Made informed assumptions (e.g., "File Structure Target: Most likely approach is separating into multiple files") documented in Assumptions section
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: FR-001 "Codebase MUST allow non-technical users to update text content by searching for the text" - verifiable by having content editor perform search and update
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 "Content editor can locate and update any piece of visible text within 2 minutes" - specific time metric, SC-002 "under 5 minutes" - quantifiable
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of React, Vue, specific build tools. Uses outcome language: "locate and update", "passes accessibility checks", "remains under 1.5 seconds"
- ✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 3 specific Given/When/Then scenarios
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 4 edge cases covering content editor errors, system failures, mental model changes, and accidental code edits
- ✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear through FR-005 (must remain GitHub Pages deployable), FR-006 (preserve zero-dependency), timeline assumption (before Oct 4 launch)
- ✅ **Assumptions documented**: Comprehensive Assumptions section covering file structure approach, tools, scope, testing, timeline, and content types

### Feature Readiness
- ✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to user story acceptance scenarios (FR-001 → US1 scenarios about searching/finding text)
- ✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Three prioritized user stories cover content editing (P1), code refactoring (P2), and adding new features (P3)
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 8 success criteria all testable: time limits (2 min, 5 min, 1.5s), verification methods (test submission, accessibility checks), binary states (documentation exists, zero dependencies maintained)
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec mentions "separate files", "data attributes" only as examples in acceptance scenarios, not as requirements. FR-007 says "separate concerns" without prescribing how

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all assumptions documented and reasonable
- Strong alignment with project constitution (Zero Dependencies, Content-First Architecture, Form Reliability, Accessibility Compliance)
- User stories are independently testable as required
